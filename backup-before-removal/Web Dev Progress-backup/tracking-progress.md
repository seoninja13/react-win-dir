## Supabase Storage Client - Refinement and Read Test (Recent Progress)

- **Objective:** Enhance the Supabase client initialization for robustness and verify the ability to read storage buckets and their contents.
- **Files Modified:**
  - `Supabase/utils/storage.ts`:
    - Refactored Supabase admin client initialization. It's now centralized, ensures environment variables are loaded prior to client creation, and the client is initialized only once.
    - Corrected the `BucketCreationOptions` interface, specifically making the `public` property a non-optional boolean to align with Supabase types and fix a lint error.
  - `Supabase/utils/test-read-storage.ts`:
    - Updated to utilize the exported helper functions (`initializeSupabaseAdmin`, `getStorageBuckets`, `getBucketObjects`) from `storage.ts`.
    - Eliminated direct dependency on the non-exported `supabaseAdmin` instance.
    - Resolved TypeScript lint errors, including module import issues and an implicit 'any' type for an iterated item.
    - Improved final console output to more accurately reflect success or failure based on caught errors.

## Environment Variable Loading Troubleshooting (Supabase Scripts)

- **Problem:** The `Supabase/utils/test-read-storage.ts` script, when executed with `npx tsx ./Supabase/utils/test-read-storage.ts`, was consistently failing to load essential environment variables (like `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`) from the `.env.local` file located in the project root. This occurred even though the `.env.local` file was correctly formatted and present.
- **Diagnostics:**
  - Initial checks in `storage.ts` showed that `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL_loaded` and `process.env.SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY_loaded` were `false`.
  - Added direct `console.log(process.env.VARIABLE_NAME)` statements at the very beginning of `test-read-storage.ts`. These also printed `undefined` for the critical variables, confirming the issue was with the variables not being available in the Node.js `process.env` object early in the script's lifecycle.
  - The current working directory (`process.cwd()`) was correctly reported as the project root, where `.env.local` resides.
- **Solution:**
  - Installed `dotenv` as a development dependency: `npm install dotenv --save-dev`.
  - Explicitly imported and configured `dotenv` at the very top of `Supabase/utils/test-read-storage.ts` by adding the line: `import 'dotenv/config';`.
- **Outcome:**
  - After this explicit import, the diagnostic logs in `test-read-storage.ts` immediately showed that the environment variables were being correctly loaded into `process.env`.
  - Consequently, the Supabase admin client in `storage.ts` initialized successfully.
  - The `test-read-storage.ts` script could then proceed to list Supabase storage buckets as intended.
- **Conclusion:** For standalone Node.js scripts executed with `tsx` in this project, relying on automatic loading of `.env.local` variables was not sufficient. Explicitly importing `dotenv/config` at the script's entry point ensures reliable environment variable loading. This practice should be adopted for other similar utility scripts if they depend on `.env` variables.

## Image Generation Batch Processing - CSV to Images (Ongoing)

  - Re-run `test-read-storage.ts` script after environment variables are confirmed.

## Vertex AI Image Generation - Quota Issues (Mid-May 2025)

- **Status:** Resolved (by waiting or for specific models) / Ongoing (general rate limits)
- **Issue:** Consistent HTTP 429 'Too Many Requests' errors for various `imagen-3.0` models and the default `imagegeneration` model in `us-west1` for project `windows-doors-website-dir-v2`. Error message: `Quota exceeded for aiplatform.googleapis.com/generate_content_requests_per_minute_per_project_per_base_model`.
- **Details:**
  - Models affected: `imagen-3.0-generate`, `imagen-3.0-generate-002`, `imagen-3.0-generate-001`, `imagen-3.0-fast-generate-001`, default `imagegeneration`.
  - Occurred with `Relume-root/src/lib/vertex-ai/test-image-generation.ts`.
  - Text generation with `gemini-2.0-flash` was functional, indicating image-specific quota issues.
- **Resolution/Workaround:**
  - Wait for quota reset.
  - Request quota increase via Google Cloud Console if persistent.
  - Confirmed `gemini-1.0-pro` (text) gave 404 Not Found, use `gemini-2.0-flash` for text.
  - Memory `93d0a327-766f-4de9-853d-d550e00168f4` notes `imagen-3.0-capability` quota at 50 requests/minute in `us-west1`.
