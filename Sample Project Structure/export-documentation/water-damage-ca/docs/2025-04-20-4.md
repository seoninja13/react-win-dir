# April 20, 2025 (Late Afternoon) - Netlify Dev Server Configuration

## Issue
The Netlify dev server was failing to start due to port conflicts, preventing access to the admin subroutes for testing.

## Resolution Steps
1. Initial attempts to run `yarn dev` were failing due to port 3006 being in use
2. Switched to using `netlify dev` command directly in start-dev.bat:
   ```batch
   @echo off
   echo Starting Netlify dev server...
   echo Access the main app at: http://localhost:8888
   echo Access the batch processor at: http://localhost:8888/admin/batch-process
   cd water-damage-ca
   netlify dev
   ```

3. Modified netlify.toml configuration to use different ports:
   ```toml
   [dev]
     command = "npx next dev -p 8080"
     port = 8888
     targetPort = 8080 # Changed from 3000 to avoid conflicts
   ```

## Key Changes That Made It Work
1. Using `netlify dev` instead of `yarn dev` - This provides proper Netlify development environment setup
2. Configuring separate ports in netlify.toml:
   - targetPort (8080) for Next.js framework
   - port (8888) for Netlify dev server
3. Ensuring proper directory context by using `cd water-damage-ca` before running the command

## Current Status
- Server is running and processing requests
- Accessible at http://localhost:8888
- Admin batch processor available at http://localhost:8888/admin/batch-process

## Known Issues
1. Warnings about unsupported metadata viewport in metadata export
2. Conflicting public file and page file for favicon.ico

## Next Steps
1. Test all admin subroutes
2. Document any issues found during testing
3. Address the viewport metadata and favicon conflicts if they impact functionality

## Testing Results

### Admin Batch Process Testing (/admin/batch-process)
1. Server Configuration:
   - Successfully configured Netlify dev server to run on port 8888
   - Next.js framework running on port 8080
   - Server accessible and responding to requests

2. Functionality Testing:
   - ✓ Page loads correctly with all UI elements
   - ✓ Process Overview section displays correct initial stats
   - ✓ Important Notes section visible with all information
   - ✓ Start Batch Process initiates processing correctly
   - ✓ Status updates to "RUNNING" when process starts
   - ✓ Progress polling works (receiving updates every ~2 seconds)
   - ✓ Cancel Process successfully stops the operation
   - ✓ Status updates to "COMPLETED" after cancellation
   - ✓ Current Step updates throughout the process

3. Batch Process Flow Verification:
   - Process correctly identifies cities to process (10 total)
   - Successfully initiates Google Places API searches
   - Properly handles business enrichment queue (668 businesses found)
   - Gracefully handles process cancellation
   - Maintains accurate stats throughout the process

4. Known Issues:
   - Non-critical viewport metadata warnings in console
   - Favicon conflicts (500 errors, but doesn't affect functionality)
   - Google Places API returning 200 status but with errors (needs investigation)

5. Next Steps:
   - Test remaining admin subroutes
   - Address viewport metadata warnings
   - Resolve favicon conflicts
   - Investigate Google Places API errors
   - Test full batch process completion (not just cancellation)
