# April 22, 2025 - Custom Tailwind Components Implementation

## Summary

Today we completed the migration from Ant Design to custom Tailwind CSS components by fixing several critical issues that were preventing the admin pages from functioning correctly. We implemented proper form handling, fixed event handling issues, and resolved hook-related errors.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Form.useForm Error

**Issue**: "useForm must be used within a Form component" error was occurring when trying to use Form.useForm() outside of a Form component.

**Solution**:
- Added Form.Provider component to provide form context
- Changed from using Form.useForm() to using refs
- Updated the Form component to support refs via React.forwardRef

**Code Changes**:
```typescript
// Before
const [form] = Form.useForm();

// After
const formRef = useRef<any>(null);

// Before
<Form form={form} layout="vertical">

// After
<Form ref={formRef} layout="vertical">
```

### 2. onPressEnter Error

**Issue**: "Unknown event handler property `onPressEnter`" error was occurring because our custom Input component didn't support this Ant Design-specific property.

**Solution**:
- Added onPressEnter property to InputProps interface
- Implemented handleKeyDown function to handle Enter key press
- Updated onPressEnter handlers to use arrow functions

**Code Changes**:
```typescript
// Added to InputProps interface
onPressEnter?: (e: React.KeyboardEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => void;

// Implementation in Input component
const handleKeyDown = (e: React.KeyboardEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {
  if (e.key === 'Enter' && onPressEnter) {
    onPressEnter(e);
  }
  
  // Call the original onKeyDown if it exists
  if (props.onKeyDown) {
    props.onKeyDown(e);
  }
};

// Usage in admin pages
<Input
  placeholder="Search by city name"
  value={searchText}
  onChange={(e) => setSearchText(e.target.value)}
  onPressEnter={() => handleSearch()}
  prefix={<SearchIcon />}
  className="max-w-md"
/>
```

### 3. Invalid Hook Call Error

**Issue**: "Invalid hook call. Hooks can only be called inside of the body of a function component" error was occurring when trying to call Form.useForm() inside useEffect.

**Solution**:
- Used React.forwardRef for the Form component
- Used refs instead of Form.useForm()
- Implemented useImperativeHandle to expose form methods

**Code Changes**:
```typescript
// Form component implementation
const FormComponent: React.FC<FormProps> = React.forwardRef((
  {
    initialValues = {},
    onFinish,
    onFinishFailed,
    layout = 'horizontal',
    className = '',
    children,
    form: externalForm,
  }, 
  ref
) => {
  // Component implementation...
  
  // Expose methods via ref
  React.useImperativeHandle(ref, () => ({
    ...formContextValue,
    validateFields: validateForm,
    setFieldsValue: (values: Record<string, any>) => {
      Object.entries(values).forEach(([name, value]) => {
        setFieldValue(name, value);
      });
    },
  }));
  
  // Return JSX...
});
```

### 4. Syntax Error

**Issue**: "Expected a semicolon" error was occurring due to incorrect syntax in the Form component.

**Solution**:
- Fixed the closing parentheses of the React.forwardRef function
- Changed from `}));` to `});`

### 5. Missing useRef Import

**Issue**: "ReferenceError: useRef is not defined" error was occurring because useRef wasn't imported.

**Solution**:
- Added useRef import to the cities and businesses pages
- `import { useState, useEffect, useRef } from "react";`

## Technical Implementation Details

### Form Component

The Form component was completely rewritten to use React's context API instead of Ant Design's form implementation. Key features include:

1. **Form Context**: Created a context to manage form state (values, errors, touched)
2. **Form.Provider**: Added a provider component for using forms outside of Form components
3. **Form.Item**: Implemented a component for individual form fields
4. **Form Validation**: Added support for field and form validation
5. **Ref Support**: Used React.forwardRef and useImperativeHandle to support refs

### Input Component

The Input component was enhanced to match Ant Design's API but using Tailwind CSS for styling. Key features include:

1. **onPressEnter Support**: Added support for the onPressEnter event
2. **Prefix/Suffix**: Support for icons or elements before/after the input
3. **Addons**: Support for elements attached to the input
4. **Clear Button**: Support for clearing the input
5. **Sizes**: Support for different input sizes

### Admin Pages

All admin pages were updated to use the new custom components:

1. **Form Initialization**: Changed from Form.useForm() to useRef
2. **Event Handling**: Updated event handlers to work with the new components
3. **Provider Wrapping**: Wrapped components with necessary providers (Form.Provider, ToastProvider)

## Benefits of the Migration

1. **Reduced Bundle Size**: Custom components are smaller and more focused
2. **Better Customization**: Tailwind CSS makes it easier to customize components
3. **Simplified Dependencies**: Fewer external dependencies to manage
4. **Consistent Styling**: All components now use the same styling system

## Next Steps

1. **Testing**: Thoroughly test all admin pages to ensure they work correctly
2. **Documentation**: Update component documentation with usage examples
3. **Optimization**: Look for opportunities to optimize the custom components
4. **Additional Components**: Create more custom components as needed
