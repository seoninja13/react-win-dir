# April 20, 2025 - Admin Dashboard Enhancements

## Overview

Today's work focused on enhancing the admin dashboard with new pages for managing cities and businesses, as well as fixing issues with the batch processing functionality.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Batch Processing Issues

- Fixed the issue with the `place_id` column in the batch processor
  - Updated the code to store the place_id in the metadata JSON field instead of a dedicated column
  - Modified the code that was trying to use the place_id column
  - Updated the database.types.ts file to remove the place_id column from the businesses table type definition

- Improved Google Places API integration
  - Enhanced error handling and response parsing
  - Fixed issues with API key usage

### 2. Admin Dashboard Navigation

- Fixed issues with the admin dashboard navigation
  - Ensured all menu items link to the correct pages
  - Implemented proper layout for all admin pages

## Features Implemented

### 1. Cities Management Page

Created a new admin page at `/admin/cities` with the following features:
- Comprehensive city listing with pagination
- Search and filter functionality
- Add, edit, and delete cities
- Form validation and error handling

### 2. Businesses Management Page

Created a new admin page at `/admin/businesses` with the following features:
- Comprehensive business listing with pagination
- Search by name and filter by city
- Add, edit, and delete businesses
- Detailed business view with enriched data and metadata
- Quick access to enrich content

### 3. Admin Dashboard Improvements

- Updated the main admin dashboard with:
  - Real-time statistics on businesses, cities, and enriched content
  - Quick access to all administrative functions
  - Improved UI with Ant Design components

## Technical Details

### Cities Management Implementation

```tsx
// Key components of the Cities Management page
const [cities, setCities] = useState<City[]>([]);
const [pagination, setPagination] = useState({
  current: 1,
  pageSize: 10,
  total: 0,
});
const [searchText, setSearchText] = useState("");

// Fetch cities with search and pagination
const fetchCities = async (page = 1, pageSize = 10, search = "") => {
  let query = ensureSupabase()
    .from("cities")
    .select("*", { count: "exact" });

  if (search) {
    query = query.ilike("name", `%${search}%`);
  }

  const { data, count, error } = await query
    .order("name", { ascending: true })
    .range((page - 1) * pageSize, page * pageSize - 1);
  
  // Update state with results
  setCities(data || []);
  setPagination({
    ...pagination,
    current: page,
    total: count || 0,
  });
};
```

### Businesses Management Implementation

```tsx
// Key components of the Businesses Management page
const [businesses, setBusinesses] = useState<Business[]>([]);
const [cities, setCities] = useState<City[]>([]);
const [selectedCity, setSelectedCity] = useState<number | null>(null);

// Fetch businesses with search, filter, and pagination
const fetchBusinesses = async (
  page = 1, 
  pageSize = 10, 
  search = "", 
  cityId: number | null = null
) => {
  let query = ensureSupabase()
    .from("businesses")
    .select("*, cities!inner(id, name, state)", { count: "exact" });

  if (search) {
    query = query.ilike("name", `%${search}%`);
  }

  if (cityId) {
    query = query.eq("city_id", cityId);
  }

  const { data, count, error } = await query
    .order("name", { ascending: true })
    .range((page - 1) * pageSize, page * pageSize - 1);
  
  // Transform data to include city information
  const transformedData = data?.map((business) => {
    const cityData = business.cities as any;
    return {
      ...business,
      city_name: cityData?.name || "Unknown",
      city_state: cityData?.state || "CA",
    };
  });

  setBusinesses(transformedData || []);
  setPagination({
    ...pagination,
    current: page,
    total: count || 0,
  });
};
```

### Batch Processing Fix

```typescript
// Updated code to handle place_id from metadata
const metadata = (business.metadata as any) || {};
const place_id = metadata?.google_places?.place_id || business.id || "";

// Use place_id from metadata for caching
await cacheEnrichedData(place_id, enrichedData);
```
