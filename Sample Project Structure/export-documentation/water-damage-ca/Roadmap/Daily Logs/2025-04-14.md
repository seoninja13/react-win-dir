## Brave Search MCP Server Implementation

Today we successfully implemented and tested the Brave Search MCP server for the Water Damage CA project. This server will allow our application to perform web searches and find local businesses using the Brave Search API.

### Tasks Completed

1. **Configured Brave Search MCP Server**
   - Added the server configuration to .mcp.json
   - Set up the Brave API key: `BSALmjQFvJ1itVQ11AJiEb-qi1WDUNo`
   - Verified the server can be installed and started

2. **Implemented Unit Tests**
   - Created basic unit tests for configuration and API functionality
   - Tested web search and local search capabilities
   - Verified API key validation
   - Implemented mocks for external dependencies

3. **Implemented Integration Tests**
   - Created tests for MCP protocol communication
   - Tested listTools and callTool requests
   - Implemented error handling tests
   - Created test runners for easy execution

4. **Created Example Usage Script**
   - Implemented an example script showing how to use the server
   - Demonstrated integration with Gemini for content enrichment
   - Provided examples of error handling and best practices

5. **Created Comprehensive Documentation**
   - Updated the main Brave Search integration documentation
   - Created a detailed testing documentation
   - Created a developer guide for using the server
   - Updated project README and tracking progress

### Server Capabilities

The Brave Search MCP server provides two main tools:

1. **brave_web_search**: Performs general web searches with pagination and filtering options
2. **brave_local_search**: Searches for local businesses and services with location information

These tools can be used to enhance content generation, research topics related to water damage and mold removal, and find additional information about businesses and services.

### Testing Results

All 15 tests are now passing, which confirms that the server is properly configured and working as expected. The tests cover:

- Configuration validation
- API key validation
- Web search functionality
- Local search functionality
- MCP protocol communication
- Error handling

### Next Steps

1. **Content Enrichment Integration**
   - Integrate the Brave Search MCP server with the content enrichment workflow
   - Create a UI for searching and using search results
   - Implement caching for search results to optimize API usage

2. **Admin Interface Integration**
   - Add search capabilities to the admin interface
   - Create a tool for researching businesses and services
   - Implement a content research feature for editors

3. **Documentation Updates**
   - Add more examples and use cases
   - Create tutorials for common workflows
   - Update the new developer guide with Brave Search information

### Notes

- The Brave Search API has a rate limit of 1 request per second and 15,000 requests per month
- The MCP server implementation includes rate limiting to prevent exceeding these limits
- The API key should be kept secure and not shared publicly
- The server can be used alongside the Gemini and Perplexity MCP servers for comprehensive content enrichment
