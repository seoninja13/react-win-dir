# Daily Log: Admin Batch Process Fix

**Date**: April 21, 2025

## Issue Summary

The admin batch process page was loading but displaying "0" for "Cities to Process" when it should have been pulling data from the database cities table where the `has_gbp` column is FALSE or NULL.

## Troubleshooting Process

1. **Initial Investigation**:
   - Confirmed that the admin page was loading correctly but showing "0" for cities count
   - Examined the batch process page component (`/app/admin/batch-process/simple-page.tsx`)
   - Identified that the state was being fetched from `/api/admin/batch-process/state`

2. **Root Cause Analysis**:
   - Discovered that the batch processor (`/lib/batchProcessor.ts`) was using a hardcoded list of target cities
   - Found that the batch state was initialized with `citiesToProcess: 0` and never updated with database data
   - Determined that the API route was not querying the database for cities that need processing

3. **Environment Testing**:
   - Tested running the application with Netlify Dev
   - Verified that the issue persisted in all environments

## Solution Implemented

1. **Added Database Query Function**:
   - Created `fetchCitiesToProcessCount()` in the batch processor
   - Function queries Supabase for cities where `has_gbp` is NULL or FALSE
   - Updates the batch process state with the correct count

2. **Updated API Route**:
   - Modified the state API route to call the new function before returning the state
   - Ensured the latest count is always available

3. **Environment Setup**:
   - Ran the application through Netlify Dev for testing
   - Confirmed that the fix works in the Netlify Dev environment

## Results

- The admin batch process page now correctly displays the number of cities that need processing
- The batch state is properly initialized with the database count
- The solution works consistently in the Netlify Dev environment

## Files Modified

1. `/lib/batchProcessor.ts`
2. `/app/api/admin/batch-process/state/route.ts`

## Documentation Created

1. Created comprehensive documentation in `/docs/admin-batch-process-troubleshooting.md`
2. Updated this daily log with the troubleshooting process and solution

## Next Steps

1. Monitor the admin batch process page to ensure the fix continues to work
2. Consider adding more robust error handling for database connection issues
3. Implement caching for database queries to improve performance
4. Add a refresh button to manually update the cities count
