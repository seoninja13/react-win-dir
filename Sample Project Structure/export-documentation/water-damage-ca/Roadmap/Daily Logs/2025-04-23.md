## Data Enrichment Distinction Implementation

Today's work focused on implementing and enforcing the distinction between Google Places data and enriched data in the database.

### Key Changes

1. **Database Updates**:
   - Updated 633 businesses with `enrichment_source = "google_places"` to have `enriched_data = null`
   - Verified that all businesses now follow the rule: if `enrichment_source = "google_places"`, then `enriched_data = null`

2. **Code Updates**:
   - Updated `batchProcessor.ts` to set `enrichment_source = "google_places"` when adding businesses from Google Places API
   - Created and ran scripts to check and fix the database:
     - `check-enrichment-status.js`: Checks the current state of the database
     - `fix-google-places-businesses.js`: Updates businesses with `enrichment_source = "google_places"` to have `enriched_data = null`
     - `update-enrichment-data.js`: Updated to use the correct `enrichment_source` value
     - `run-direct-sql-update.js`: Updated to use the correct `enrichment_source` value

3. **Documentation**:
   - Created `data-enrichment-distinction.md` to clearly document the distinction between GBP data and enriched data
   - Updated existing documentation to use the correct `enrichment_source` values
   - Added detailed business rules and enrichment process flow

### Current Database State

- 688 total businesses in the database
- 55 businesses have `enrichment_source = "openrouter web search"` and non-null `enriched_data`
- 633 businesses have `enrichment_source = "google_places"` and null `enriched_data`
- No businesses have inconsistent data

### Next Steps

1. Continue monitoring the database to ensure the rule is enforced
2. Update the batch process dashboard to correctly count enriched businesses
3. Consider adding database constraints to enforce this rule at the database level

## Hours Worked: 3

## Notes

This change ensures that the system correctly distinguishes between businesses with basic Google Places data and those with enriched content from OpenRouter web search. This distinction is important for accurately counting enriched businesses in the batch process dashboard.
