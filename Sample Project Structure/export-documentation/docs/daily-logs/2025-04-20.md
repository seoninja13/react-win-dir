# Daily Development Log: April 20, 2025

## Overview
Today's focus was on implementing extensive logging and diagnostic tools to help identify issues with the admin routes, particularly in the Netlify Dev environment. We also conducted manual testing of all admin subroutes to verify their functionality.

## Tasks Completed

### 1. Enhanced Logging System
- Created a new API endpoint for logging at `/api/logs/route.ts`
- Enhanced the existing logger with additional features in `lib/utils/enhanced-logger.ts`
- Added specialized loggers for different admin components
- Implemented performance timing, error tracking, and browser environment detection

### 2. Diagnostic System
- Created a comprehensive diagnostics API at `/api/diagnostics/route.ts`
- Implemented a diagnostics page at `/admin/diagnostics/page.tsx`
- Added checks for Supabase connection, environment variables, API routes, and more
- Included browser environment information in diagnostics

### 3. Enhanced Batch Process Page
- Created an enhanced version of the batch process page with extensive logging
- Added performance metrics, API call tracking, and detailed error reporting
- Implemented a more user-friendly interface with better error handling

### 4. Manual Testing
- Tested all admin subroutes in both Next.js development server (port 3000) and Netlify Dev (port 8888)
- Identified issues with admin routes not loading properly in Netlify Dev environment
- Verified that the API routes are correctly implemented but may not be responding properly

### 5. Documentation Updates
- Updated the README.md to emphasize using Netlify Dev for testing
- Created this daily log to document progress and issues

## Issues Identified

### Netlify Dev Environment Issues
- Admin routes not loading properly in Netlify Dev environment (port 8888)
- No visible errors in the terminal output, making diagnosis difficult
- API routes may not be correctly set up or responding in Netlify Dev

### Next.js Development Server
- Admin routes loading properly in Next.js development server (port 3000)
- No console errors visible when accessing admin routes

### Potential Causes
1. **Environment Variables**: May not be correctly loaded by Netlify Dev
2. **API Route Issues**: Routes may not be correctly set up or responding
3. **Client-Side Rendering**: Components may have issues with server-side rendering
4. **Netlify Dev Configuration**: May not be correctly set up for admin routes
5. **Next.js Configuration**: May not be correctly set up for Netlify Dev

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. Review the diagnostics data to identify specific issues
2. Check environment variable loading in Netlify Dev
3. Verify API route implementation and responses
4. Test client-side components in isolation
5. Review Netlify Dev and Next.js configuration

### Future Improvements
1. Implement more comprehensive error handling
2. Add more detailed logging for API routes
3. Create a monitoring dashboard for system health
4. Improve documentation for troubleshooting common issues

## Testing Notes
- Always test in both Next.js development server (port 3000) and Netlify Dev (port 8888)
- Use the diagnostics page and API to identify issues
- Check browser console for client-side errors
- Review terminal output for server-side errors
