# Windows Doors CA - Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the detailed implementation plan for extracting content from the Relume folder and organizing it according to React best practices in the Relume-root directory. The plan ensures that the original Relume folder remains untouched while creating a well-structured, maintainable codebase.

## Analysis of Current Structure

### Relume Folder Structure
- The Relume folder contains a comprehensive set of components organized by page/section
- Each page has its own folder with components subfolder
- The structure follows the website architecture of www.windowsdoorsca.com
- Components are organized by functionality and page location

### Current Project Structure
- Next.js 15.3.2 with App Router
- Pages are organized in the src/app directory
- Components are in the src/components directory
- Current pages include: windows, doors, vinyl-siding, roofing, contact, and logging-test

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Create Relume-root Directory
1. Create a new directory called "Relume-root" at the project root
2. Create subdirectories in Relume-root that mirror the React best practices structure:
   - Relume-root/components
   - Relume-root/pages
   - Relume-root/layouts
   - Relume-root/hooks
   - Relume-root/utils

### Phase 2: Extract and Organize Components
1. For each page in the Relume folder:
   - Extract the main page component
   - Extract reusable components
   - Organize them according to React best practices

2. Component Organization Rules:
   - Page-specific components go to Relume-root/pages/{page-name}
   - Reusable components go to Relume-root/components
   - Layout components go to Relume-root/layouts
   - Utility functions go to Relume-root/utils
   - Custom hooks go to Relume-root/hooks

### Phase 3: Documentation
1. Create comprehensive documentation for each component
2. Document the relationship between components
3. Create a component map showing how components are linked
4. Document any adjustments made (with explicit approval)

## Detailed Steps

### Step 1: Create Relume-root Directory Structure
```
mkdir Relume-root
mkdir Relume-root\components
mkdir Relume-root\pages
mkdir Relume-root\layouts
mkdir Relume-root\hooks
mkdir Relume-root\utils
```

### Step 2: Extract Home Page Components
1. Copy components from Relume/www.windowsdoorsca.com/home/components to Relume-root/pages/home
2. Identify reusable components and copy to Relume-root/components
3. Document component relationships

### Step 3: Extract Windows Page Components
1. Copy components from Relume/www.windowsdoorsca.com/windows/components to Relume-root/pages/windows
2. Identify reusable components and copy to Relume-root/components
3. Document component relationships

### Step 4: Extract Doors Page Components
1. Copy components from Relume/www.windowsdoorsca.com/doors/components to Relume-root/pages/doors
2. Identify reusable components and copy to Relume-root/components
3. Document component relationships

### Step 5: Extract Vinyl Siding Page Components
1. Copy components from Relume/www.windowsdoorsca.com/vinyl-siding/components to Relume-root/pages/vinyl-siding
2. Identify reusable components and copy to Relume-root/components
3. Document component relationships

### Step 6: Extract Roofing Page Components
1. Copy components from Relume/www.windowsdoorsca.com/roofing/components to Relume-root/pages/roofing
2. Identify reusable components and copy to Relume-root/components
3. Document component relationships

### Step 7: Extract Contact Page Components
1. Copy components from Relume/www.windowsdoorsca.com/contact/components to Relume-root/pages/contact
2. Identify reusable components and copy to Relume-root/components
3. Document component relationships

### Step 8: Extract Other Page Components
1. Identify other important pages from the Relume folder
2. Copy components to appropriate locations in the Relume-root directory
3. Document component relationships

### Step 9: Create Component Documentation
1. Create README.md files for each component directory
2. Document component purpose, props, and usage
3. Create a component map showing relationships

### Step 10: Create Project Documentation
1. Create a main README.md in the Relume-root directory
2. Document the overall structure and organization
3. Provide guidelines for using the components

## Implementation Notes

- The Relume folder will remain untouched throughout this process
- All files will be copied, not moved
- No changes will be made to the original files
- Any necessary adjustments will be documented and require explicit approval
- The implementation will follow React best practices for component organization

## Directory Structure

```
Relume-root/
├── components/       # Reusable components
├── pages/            # Page-specific components
│   ├── home/
│   ├── windows/

```

## Component Organization

### Reusable Components
Components that are used across multiple pages should be placed in the `components` directory. These include:

- Header
- Footer
- Navigation
- Buttons
- Forms
- Cards
- Testimonials
- Gallery
- FAQ accordions

### Page-Specific Components
Components that are only used on a specific page should be placed in the corresponding page directory. For example:

- Home page hero section
- Windows product showcase
- Doors comparison table
- Vinyl siding color selector
- Roofing material display
- Contact form

### Layout Components
Components that define the overall layout of pages should be placed in the `layouts` directory. These include:

- Main layout
- Sidebar layout
- Product detail layout
- Blog post layout

### Hooks
Custom React hooks should be placed in the `hooks` directory. These might include:

- useWindowSize
- useScrollPosition
- useLocalStorage
- useForm

### Utils
Utility functions should be placed in the `utils` directory. These include:

- API calls
- Data formatting
- Validation functions
- Helper functions

## Documentation Standards

All documentation will follow a consistent format:

1. **Component Name**: Clear, descriptive name
2. **Purpose**: What the component does
3. **Props**: List of props with types and descriptions
4. **Usage Example**: Code snippet showing how to use the component
5. **Dependencies**: List of dependencies
6. **Notes**: Any additional information or considerations

Example:
```markdown
# Button Component

## Purpose
A reusable button component with various styles and sizes.

## Props
- `variant`: string - 'primary' | 'secondary' | 'outline' (default: 'primary')
- `size`: string - 'sm' | 'md' | 'lg' (default: 'md')
- `onClick`: function - Click handler
- `disabled`: boolean - Whether the button is disabled (default: false)
- `children`: ReactNode - Button content

## Usage Example
```jsx
<Button variant="primary" size="lg" onClick={handleClick}>
  Submit
</Button>
```

## Dependencies
- None

## Notes
- Uses Tailwind CSS for styling
- Accessible with keyboard navigation
```
