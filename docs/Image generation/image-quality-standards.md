## Overview

This document defines the quality standards for images generated using Google Cloud's Generative AI for the Windows Doors CA website. These standards ensure that all generated images meet our requirements for technical quality, visual appeal, content appropriateness, and brand consistency.

The standards serve as:
1. Guidelines for prompt engineering
2. Criteria for image evaluation and selection
3. Benchmarks for quality assurance
4. Reference for continuous improvement
