## Overview

This implementation plan outlines the strategy for generating images for the Windows Doors CA website using Google Cloud's Generative AI SDK. The plan leverages the existing CSV file containing Window World LA website URLs, images, and prompts, and adapts them for our website.

## Objectives

1. Create high-quality, consistent images for all pages of the Windows Doors CA website
2. Ensure generated images match the style and branding of the original Window World LA website
3. Implement an efficient process for generating, reviewing, and integrating images
4. Establish a systematic approach to URL mapping between the original site and our implementation
5. Optimize prompts for best results with Google's Generative AI models

## Prerequisites

2. Create URL mapping between Window World LA and Windows Doors CA
3. Review and refine existing prompts
4. Categorize pages by image priority

### Phase 2: Prompt Engineering (Days 3-4)

3. Develop prompt enhancement strategies
4. Test prompts with sample pages

### Phase 3: Batch Processing Setup (Days 5-6)

1. Develop batch processing script
2. Implement logging and error handling
3. Set up Supabase storage integration
4. Create metadata tracking system

### Phase 4: Image Generation (Days 7-14)

1. Generate images in batches by page category
2. Implement review process
3. Regenerate images as needed
4. Store final images in Supabase

### Phase 5: Website Integration (Days 15-18)

1. Update website code to use generated images
2. Implement lazy loading and optimization
3. Test across different devices and browsers
4. Document image usage across the site

## CSV Data Processing

### CSV Structure Analysis

The CSV file contains the following columns:
- Original URL (Window World LA)
- Image path/URL
- Prompt used for generation
- Additional metadata

### Processing Steps

1. Parse the CSV file to extract all data
2. Clean and normalize URLs
3. Categorize entries by page type (home, product, service, etc.)
4. Identify missing or incomplete entries
5. Create a structured JSON representation for programmatic access

### Data Validation

1. Verify all URLs are valid
2. Ensure all entries have corresponding prompts
3. Check for duplicate entries
4. Validate image paths

## URL Mapping Strategy

### Mapping Approach

1. Create a direct 1:1 mapping where possible
2. For pages with different structures:
   - Map based on content similarity
   - Map based on page function
   - Create new mappings for Windows Doors CA specific pages

### URL Pattern Matching

| Window World LA Pattern | Windows Doors CA Pattern |
|------------------------|--------------------------|
| `/windows/[type]`      | `/windows/[type]`        |
| `/doors/[type]`        | `/doors/[type]`          |
| `/siding/[type]`       | `/vinyl-siding/[type]`   |
| `/about-us`            | `/about-us`              |
| `/contact`             | `/contact-us`            |

### Special Cases

1. Location-specific pages will be adapted to Windows Doors CA service areas
2. Testimonial pages will use Windows Doors CA specific content
3. Blog posts will be mapped based on topic similarity

## Prompt Engineering

### Prompt Structure

Each prompt will follow this structure:
```
Generate a [style] image of [subject] for a windows and doors website. 
The image should feature [specific elements] with [specific attributes].
Style: [detailed style description]
Mood: [mood description]
Lighting: [lighting description]
Perspective: [perspective description]
```

### Style Consistency

To maintain visual consistency across the website:
1. Define a standard style guide for all images
2. Include brand colors in prompts
3. Specify consistent lighting and perspective
4. Use similar compositional elements

### Prompt Enhancement

1. Analyze high-performing prompts from the CSV
2. Identify patterns in successful prompts
3. Enhance prompts with additional details
4. Test variations to determine optimal structure

### Page-Specific Prompt Templates

#### Home Page
```
Generate a professional, welcoming image of a modern home with beautiful [product] installed. 
The home should have [specific architectural features] and be set against a [background description].
Style: Clean, professional, aspirational
Mood: Inviting, comfortable, premium
Lighting: Bright, natural daylight
Perspective: Front view with clear focus on the [product]
```

#### Product Pages
```
Generate a detailed image of a [product type] [product]. 
The [product] should be [color/material] and feature [specific features].
Style: Detailed, product-focused, informative
Mood: Professional, high-quality
Lighting: Even, highlighting product details
Perspective: [specific angle] to showcase key features
```

#### Service Pages
```
Generate an image showing [service] being performed on a home.
The image should show [specific service details] with [tools/equipment].
Style: Action-oriented, professional
Mood: Competent, reliable
Lighting: Natural, work-appropriate
Perspective: Close enough to see details of the work
```

## Image Generation Process

### Batch Processing Strategy

1. Group pages by category (home, windows, doors, etc.)
2. Process high-priority pages first
3. Generate 3-5 variations per prompt
4. Implement automatic and manual review processes

### Generation Parameters

- Model: `gemini-2.0-flash-preview-image-generation`
- Resolution: 1024x1024 (can be cropped as needed)
- Aspect ratios: 1:1, 16:9, 4:3 (depending on page placement)
- Number of variations: 3-5 per prompt

### Error Handling

1. Implement retry logic for failed generations
2. Log all errors with prompt details
3. Create alternative prompts for consistently failing cases
4. Establish manual intervention process for complex cases

### Progress Tracking

1. Create a tracking database in Supabase
2. Record status of each image (pending, generated, reviewed, approved, integrated)
3. Track generation attempts, errors, and successes
4. Generate daily progress reports

## Quality Assurance

### Review Process

1. Automated filtering:
   - Check image dimensions
   - Verify image quality metrics
   - Screen for obvious issues

2. Manual review:
   - Visual quality assessment
   - Brand consistency check
   - Content appropriateness verification

### Acceptance Criteria

1. Image clearly represents the intended subject
2. Style is consistent with website branding
3. No visible artifacts or generation issues
4. Appropriate for target audience
5. Meets technical specifications (resolution, aspect ratio)

### Regeneration Process

1. Identify issues in rejected images
2. Refine prompts based on feedback
3. Adjust generation parameters if needed
4. Prioritize regeneration in batch queue

## Storage and Integration

### Storage Structure

Images will be stored in Supabase with the following structure:
```
/images
  /pages
    /home
    /windows
      /double-hung
      /casement
      /...
    /doors
      /entry
      /patio
      /...
    /vinyl-siding
    /...
  /components
    /headers
    /backgrounds
    /icons
```

### Metadata Storage

Each image will have associated metadata stored in Supabase:
- Original prompt
- Generation parameters
- URL mapping
- Generation date
- Approval status
- Usage locations

### Website Integration

1. Update page components to reference generated images
2. Implement responsive image handling
3. Add proper alt text based on prompts
4. Implement lazy loading for performance

3. **Quality Consistency**: Maintaining consistent quality across all generated images
   - Mitigation: Strict review process, style guides, prompt templates

4. **API Limitations**: Rate limits or downtime could delay generation
   - Mitigation: Implement retry logic, spread generation over time

5. **Content Policy Violations**: Generated images might inadvertently violate content policies
   - Mitigation: Implement content filtering, clear guidelines in prompts

## Success Metrics

1. **Coverage**: Percentage of pages with successfully generated images
