## Routing Architecture

The project is currently in transition from a mixed routing approach to a standardized App Router approach:

### Current Routing Structure

1. **Pages Router** (`Relume-root/pages/`): Contains legacy pages that are being migrated to the App Router.
   - Example: `Relume-root/pages/windows.js` â†’ `export { default } from '../windows';`

2. **App Router** (`Relume-root/src/app/`): Contains the target architecture pages.
   - Example: `Relume-root/src/app/windows/page.tsx` â†’ Imports components from `Relume-root/Website Pages/windows/`

### Routing Priority

Next.js prioritizes routes in the following order:
1. `/pages` directory (Pages Router)
2. `/src/app` directory (App Router)

This means that if a route exists in both directories, the Pages Router version will be used. This is important to understand during the migration process.

## Component Organization

The project organizes components in the following way:

1. **Page-Specific Components**: Located in the `Relume-root/Website Pages/` directory.
   - Example: `Relume-root/Website Pages/windows/components/Header44.jsx`

2. **Shared Components**: Located in `Relume-root/components/`.
   - Example: `Relume-root/components/Button.jsx`

3. **App Router Components**: Located in `Relume-root/src/components/`.
   - Example: `Relume-root/src/components/LoggingProvider.jsx`

## Development Tools

The project includes several development tools inspired by David Jones Gelardi's "Vibe Coding" approach. These tools are designed to enhance the development workflow, improve code quality, and streamline collaboration between developers and AI tools.

### Implemented Vibe Coding Features

1. **Intelligent Commit Reminders & Assistance**
   - Provides timely reminders to commit changes and assistance in creating meaningful commit messages
   - Implemented in `Relume-root/scripts/commit-assistant/`
   - Configured via `.commit-assistant.json`
   - Documentation: `Docs/features/intelligent-commit-reminders.md`

2. **Code Modularity & Refactoring Tools**
   - Helps developers maintain clean, modular code by analyzing files for complexity and length
   - Implemented in `Relume-root/scripts/code-modularity/`
   - Configured via `.code-modularity.json`
   - Documentation: `Docs/features/code-modularity-tools.md`

3. **To-Do List Management with AI Sync**
   - Provides a seamless, project-aware task management system that integrates with AI tools
   - Implemented in `Relume-root/scripts/todo-list/`
   - Configured via `.todo-config.json`
   - Documentation: `Docs/features/todo-list-management.md`

4. **File Naming Convention**
   - Implements a standardized file naming convention using hyphenated path names
   - Documentation: `Docs/processes/file-naming-convention.md`

### Planned Vibe Coding Features

The following features are planned for future implementation:

1. **Code Audit Detection** (Next to implement)
2. **Automated Testing**
3. **AI Rule Configuration**
4. **Automation Scripting**
5. **AI Change Review**
6. **Multi-Agent Comparison**

For more details, see the [Vibe Coding Implementation Plan](../features/vibe-coding-implementation.md).

## Known Issues

The following issues have been identified in the current project structure:

1. **Routing Conflicts**: Pages with both Pages Router and App Router implementations may experience routing conflicts, with the Pages Router taking precedence.

2. **Inconsistent Directory Structure**: Some App Router pages are in `src/app/` (outside Relume-root) while others are in `Relume-root/src/app/`.

3. **Simplified Debug Versions**: Some pages have simplified debug versions that were created for testing purposes, which may cause conflicts.

4. **Import Path Issues**: Some components have incorrect import paths, especially when referencing components across different directories.

5. **Page Testing Requirement**: **CRITICAL** - Never assume pages are working without explicit user confirmation. The only affirmative sign that a page is working is manual human inspection and confirmation.

## Next Steps

The following steps are planned to address the current issues and complete the migration:

1. **Resolve Routing Conflicts**:
   - Temporarily rename or move Pages Router implementations to allow App Router implementations to take precedence
   - Eventually remove all Pages Router implementations once App Router versions are confirmed working

2. **Standardize Directory Structure**:
   - Ensure all App Router pages are in `Relume-root/src/app/` and not in `src/app/`
   - Update import paths to reflect the correct directory structure

3. **Remove Simplified Debug Versions**:
   - Remove or rename simplified debug versions of pages to avoid conflicts

4. **Complete Page Migrations**:
   - Migrate remaining pages from Pages Router to App Router
   - Test each page thoroughly to ensure it works correctly
