This inventory is crucial for ensuring all visual elements are correctly sourced or recreated and placed within the replicated website, maintaining visual consistency and brand messaging.

* **Logo Usage**: The Window World logo is a cornerstone of the visual identity, appearing prominently in the header (typically top-left or centered) and often in the footer of every page.
* **Color Palette**:
  * Primary CTA Button Text: White text on the teal background ensures high contrast and readability.
  * Headline Text (H1, H2): Black.
  * Paragraph Text: Black.
  * A full color palette, including accent colors, background shades, and link colors, would need to be systematically sampled from the live website using browser developer tools or image analysis.

### Interactive Elements

#### Buttons

* **Primary CTAs** (e.g., "Request Free Estimate"): Characterized by a teal background, white text, slightly rounded corners, and no visible border. These are found extensively across the site.
* **Secondary Buttons** (e.g., "Learn More!", "View More", "Shop All... Styles"): Styles vary. Some are styled text links, while others might be ghost buttons or have a less prominent solid color. Their specific appearance (background, text color, border, shape) and hover/active states must be observed on the live site.

#### Pop-up/Modal (Exit-Intent)

* A "Wait! You Forgot Your Free Estimate!" pop-up or modal appears to be triggered when a user shows intent to leave the page. This element typically includes a direct call to action, such as a phone number or a button to submit the RFE form. This is a specific UX strategy aimed at maximizing lead capture from departing visitors.

* **Header & Navigation**: The main horizontal navigation menu (containing "Windows," "Doors," "Siding," etc.) is highly likely to collapse into a "hamburger" icon (three horizontal lines) or a "Menu" button on smaller tablet and mobile screens. This is a common pattern to conserve space and improve usability. The utility links and contact information in the top bar might also stack vertically or be integrated into this collapsed mobile menu.
* **Hero Section**: Content within the hero section, including text and any embedded RFE forms, will almost certainly stack vertically on mobile devices. Background images will likely be resized, cropped, or replaced with mobile-optimized versions to ensure they display effectively.
* **Content Grids**: Sections like "Our Featured Products", which display items in a multi-column grid on desktops, will reflow. On tablets, the number of columns might reduce, and on mobile screens, items will typically stack into a single vertical column.
* **Multi-Column Layouts**: Any general multi-column layouts used in the main content areas of various pages will collapse to a single-column layout on mobile devices to ensure readability and prevent horizontal scrolling.
* **Footer**: The columns within the footer (containing links, contact information, etc.) will likely stack vertically on smaller screens.
* **Images**: All images will scale down proportionally to fit the available screen width, maintaining their aspect ratio.
* **Forms**: Form fields within RFE forms and other forms will generally expand to take up the full available width on mobile screens for easier tapping and data entry.
