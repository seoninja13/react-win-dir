## System Overview

### Dual MCP Architecture

Our project uses two complementary MCP servers:

#### **Linear MCP Server**
- **Purpose:** Project and task management
- **Access:** Built into Augment Code IDE
- **Project:** Window World LA Website
- **URL:** https://linear.app/1builder/project/window-world-la-website-b0de4f49730a

#### **Sequential Thinking MCP Server**
- **Purpose:** Complex workflow orchestration and problem-solving
- **Access:** Built into Augment Code IDE
- **Integration:** Works seamlessly with Linear MCP

### Key Benefits

1. **Enhanced Productivity:** Automated workflows reduce manual work
2. **Better Decision Making:** AI-assisted analysis and planning
3. **Improved Documentation:** Automated generation and updates
4. **Clear Audit Trail:** Complete tracking of decisions and actions

## Linear MCP Server Training

### Getting Started

#### **Accessing Linear MCP:**
1. Open Augment Code IDE
2. Access Linear MCP through the integrated tools
3. Navigate to "Window World LA Website" project

#### **Project Structure:**
```
Window World LA Website Project
├── Epic: Project Structure Standardization (1BU-10) [URGENT]
├── Epic: Vibe Coding Implementation (1BU-11) [HIGH]
├── Epic: App Router Migration (1BU-12) [HIGH]
├── Epic: Image Generation Integration (1BU-13) [MEDIUM]
└── Epic: Knowledge Base Development (1BU-14) [MEDIUM]
```

### Task Management

#### **Creating Tasks:**
1. Navigate to the appropriate Epic or Feature
2. Click "Create Issue"
3. Select task type (Epic, Feature, Task, Bug)
4. Fill in title and description
5. Set priority and assignee
6. Link to related tasks if applicable

#### **Task Lifecycle:**
```
Backlog → Todo → In Progress → In Review → Done
```

#### **Priority Levels:**
- **Urgent (1):** Critical foundation issues
- **High (2):** Important features and fixes
- **Medium (3):** Enhancement features
- **Low (4):** Nice-to-have features

### Best Practices

1. **Use descriptive titles** that clearly indicate the work to be done
2. **Include acceptance criteria** in task descriptions
3. **Link related tasks** to maintain traceability
4. **Update status regularly** to keep the team informed
5. **Add comments** for important updates or decisions

## Sequential Thinking MCP Server Training

### When to Use ST-MCP

Use Sequential Thinking MCP for:

1. **Complex Problem Analysis:** Multi-step problem-solving
2. **Planning and Breakdown:** Epic and feature planning
3. **Documentation Generation:** Comprehensive documentation creation
4. **Decision Making:** Evaluating options and trade-offs
5. **Workflow Automation:** Multi-step process execution

### Basic Usage

#### **Starting a Workflow:**
1. Identify the need for complex analysis or planning
2. Access Sequential Thinking MCP in Augment Code
3. Describe the problem or task clearly
4. Let ST-MCP guide you through the thinking process
5. Review and refine the results

#### **Integration with Linear:**
1. Reference Linear task ID in ST-MCP workflows
2. Update Linear tasks with ST-MCP results
3. Link generated documentation to Linear tasks
4. Maintain bidirectional traceability

## Workflow Demonstrations

### Demo 1: Epic Planning with Dual MCP

**Scenario:** Planning a new Epic for performance optimization

**Steps:**
1. **Linear MCP:** Create Epic "Performance Optimization"
2. **ST-MCP:** Analyze performance requirements and constraints
3. **ST-MCP:** Generate feature breakdown and task hierarchy
4. **Linear MCP:** Create Features and Tasks based on ST-MCP analysis
5. **Linear MCP:** Set priorities and dependencies
6. **ST-MCP:** Generate implementation documentation

### Demo 2: Complex Problem Resolution

**Scenario:** Resolving import statement conflicts

**Steps:**
1. **Linear MCP:** Create task "Fix Import Statement Conflicts"
2. **ST-MCP:** Analyze codebase to identify all conflicts
3. **ST-MCP:** Generate resolution strategy with multiple options
4. **ST-MCP:** Evaluate trade-offs and recommend solution
5. **Linear MCP:** Update task with recommended solution
6. **Linear MCP:** Track implementation progress

## Common Patterns

### Pattern 1: Research and Analysis
```
Linear Task → ST-MCP Analysis → Linear Update → Implementation
```

### Pattern 2: Documentation Generation
```
Documentation Request → ST-MCP Generation → Review → Linear Complete
```

### Pattern 3: Planning and Breakdown
```
Epic Creation → ST-MCP Planning → Feature Creation → Task Assignment
```

## Best Practices

### Task Management
1. **Always link** Linear tasks to ST-MCP workflows when applicable
2. **Use consistent naming** across both systems
3. **Update both systems** when status changes
4. **Maintain clear descriptions** and acceptance criteria

### Documentation
1. **Include Linear task references** in all documentation
2. **Use ST-MCP** for comprehensive documentation generation
3. **Link documentation back** to Linear tasks
4. **Keep documentation current** with project changes

### Communication
1. **Share workflow results** with the team
2. **Document decisions** and rationale
3. **Use comments** for important updates
4. **Maintain transparency** in all processes

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### **Cannot Access Linear MCP:**
- Check Augment Code IDE connection
- Verify project permissions
- Refresh workspace if needed

#### **ST-MCP Workflow Not Starting:**
- Check problem description clarity
- Verify input parameters
- Try restarting the workflow

#### **Integration Issues:**
- Verify linking conventions
- Check network connectivity
- Manually sync if needed
