## System Introduction

### Opening Statement
"Today we'll explore our new dual MCP workflow system that enhances our development process through intelligent task management and automated workflow orchestration."

### Key Points to Cover
1. **Why we implemented this system:**
   - Improved project organization and tracking
   - Enhanced decision-making through AI assistance
   - Automated documentation and workflow processes
   - Better team collaboration and transparency

2. **What we'll demonstrate:**
   - Linear MCP for project and task management
   - Sequential Thinking MCP for complex problem-solving
   - Integration between both systems
   - Real-world workflow examples

## Linear MCP Demonstration

### Demo Setup
**Screen:** Open Augment Code IDE with Linear MCP integration
**Project:** Window World LA Website project

### Demo Script

#### **Step 1: Project Overview (2 minutes)**
"Let's start by looking at our project structure in Linear MCP."

**Actions:**
1. Navigate to Window World LA Website project
2. Show Epic hierarchy (1BU-10 through 1BU-14)
3. Explain priority levels (Urgent, High, Medium, Low)
4. Demonstrate filtering and search capabilities

**Key Points:**
- "Notice how our work is organized into clear Epics and Features"
- "Priority levels help us focus on the most critical work first"
- "Each task has clear ownership and status tracking"

#### **Step 2: Task Management (4 minutes)**
"Now let's see how we create and manage tasks."

**Actions:**
1. Create a new task: "Demo: Test Task Creation"
2. Set description, priority, and assignee
3. Show task lifecycle: Backlog → Todo → In Progress → Done
4. Demonstrate linking related tasks
5. Add comments and updates

**Key Points:**
- "Descriptive titles and clear acceptance criteria are essential"
- "Always link related tasks to maintain traceability"
- "Regular status updates keep the team informed"

#### **Step 3: Epic and Feature Navigation (4 minutes)**
"Let's explore how Epics break down into Features and Tasks."

**Actions:**
1. Navigate to Epic 1BU-10 (Project Structure Standardization)
2. Show Feature breakdown (1BU-17, 1BU-21)
3. Demonstrate task hierarchy and dependencies
4. Show progress tracking at Epic level

**Key Points:**
- "Epics provide high-level business value"
- "Features group related functionality"
- "Tasks are specific, actionable work items"

## Sequential Thinking MCP Demonstration

### Demo Setup
**Screen:** Sequential Thinking MCP interface in Augment Code
**Scenario:** Planning a complex feature implementation

### Demo Script

#### **Step 1: Problem Analysis (3 minutes)**
"Sequential Thinking MCP helps us analyze complex problems systematically."

**Actions:**
1. Present a complex scenario: "How should we approach the Vibe Coding implementation?"
2. Use ST-MCP to break down the problem
3. Show the thinking process and analysis steps
4. Demonstrate how ST-MCP considers multiple factors

**Key Points:**
- "ST-MCP provides structured thinking for complex decisions"
- "It considers multiple perspectives and constraints"
- "The analysis is documented for future reference"

#### **Step 2: Solution Generation (3 minutes)**
"Now let's see how ST-MCP generates and evaluates solutions."

**Actions:**
1. Continue the Vibe Coding scenario
2. Show how ST-MCP generates multiple solution options
3. Demonstrate trade-off analysis
4. Show recommendation with rationale

**Key Points:**
- "Multiple options are always considered"
- "Trade-offs are clearly identified and evaluated"
- "Recommendations come with clear reasoning"

#### **Step 3: Documentation Creation (2 minutes)**
"ST-MCP can also generate comprehensive documentation."

**Actions:**
1. Show how ST-MCP creates implementation plans
2. Demonstrate documentation structure and content
3. Show how results link back to Linear tasks

**Key Points:**
- "Documentation is generated automatically"
- "Structure follows our established standards"
- "Everything links back to project tasks"

## Integration Workflow

### Demo Setup
**Screen:** Both Linear MCP and ST-MCP interfaces
**Scenario:** End-to-end workflow from task creation to completion

### Demo Script

#### **Step 1: Task Creation and Analysis (3 minutes)**
"Let's see how both systems work together in a real workflow."

**Actions:**
1. Create task in Linear: "Implement Code Audit Detection"
2. Use ST-MCP to analyze implementation requirements
3. Show how ST-MCP results inform task breakdown
4. Update Linear task with analysis results

**Key Points:**
- "Complex tasks benefit from ST-MCP analysis"
- "Analysis results directly inform task planning"
- "Both systems maintain linked records"

#### **Step 2: Implementation and Documentation (2 minutes)**
"During implementation, both systems track progress."

**Actions:**
1. Show task progress updates in Linear
2. Demonstrate ST-MCP workflow execution
3. Show automated documentation generation
4. Update Linear with completion status

**Key Points:**
- "Progress is tracked in real-time"
- "Documentation is generated automatically"
- "Both systems stay synchronized"

#### **Step 3: Review and Completion (2 minutes)**
"Finally, let's see how workflows complete and link together."

**Actions:**
1. Show completed task in Linear
2. Review generated documentation
3. Demonstrate linking between systems
4. Show audit trail and decision history

**Key Points:**
- "Complete audit trail is maintained"
- "All decisions and rationale are documented"
- "Links provide easy navigation between systems"

## Q&A and Discussion

### Common Questions to Address

#### **Q: When should I use ST-MCP vs. just Linear?**
**A:** "Use ST-MCP for complex analysis, planning, or when you need to think through multiple options. Use Linear for straightforward task management and tracking."

#### **Q: How do I know if my workflow is working correctly?**
**A:** "Both systems should stay synchronized, with clear links between related items. If something seems disconnected, check the linking conventions."

#### **Q: What if I make a mistake or need to change something?**
**A:** "Both systems allow updates and corrections. The key is to maintain the links and update both systems when changes occur."

#### **Q: How does this affect our existing processes?**
**A:** "This enhances our existing processes rather than replacing them. We still follow the same development workflow, but with better tools and automation."

### Discussion Points

1. **Team Feedback:** "What aspects of this system seem most valuable for your work?"
2. **Concerns:** "Are there any concerns or challenges you foresee?"
3. **Training Needs:** "What additional training or support would be helpful?"
4. **Implementation:** "How should we roll this out to the team?"

## Follow-Up Actions

### Immediate Next Steps
1. **Practice Session:** Schedule hands-on practice time for each team member
2. **Documentation Review:** Ensure everyone has access to training materials
3. **Support Setup:** Establish support channels for questions and issues
4. **Feedback Collection:** Set up process for ongoing feedback and improvement

### Ongoing Support
1. **Weekly Check-ins:** Monitor adoption and address issues
2. **Process Refinement:** Adjust workflows based on team feedback
3. **Advanced Training:** Provide additional training as needed
4. **System Updates:** Keep team informed of improvements and changes
