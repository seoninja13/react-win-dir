## Priority Details

### Knowledge Base System Implementation Details

The Knowledge Base System is a critical component of the Windows Doors CA website project. It provides a powerful, searchable repository for documentation, API references, code snippets, and other information. The system uses Supabase's pgvector capabilities and Gemini 2.0 Flash embeddings to create a semantic search experience.

#### Implementation Details

1. **Semantic Chunking Process**
   - Hierarchical chunking approach (paragraphs → sentences → words)
   - Overlap management to maintain context
   - Chunk size optimization

2. **Embedding Generation**
   - Gemini 2.0 Flash for embedding generation
   - Rate limiting implementation
   - Batch processing for efficiency

3. **Vector Storage**
   - Supabase pgvector for vector storage
   - Indexing strategies for efficient retrieval
   - Metadata attachment for filtering

4. **Search Functionality**
   - Query embedding generation
   - Vector similarity search
   - Result ranking and filtering

#### Success Criteria

- Successful implementation of all key components
- Comprehensive documentation
- Efficient search functionality
- Integration with website
