# Development Progress

## Supabase Storage Client - Refinement and Read Test (Recent Progress)

- **Objective:** Enhance the Supabase client initialization for robustness and verify the ability to read storage buckets and their contents.
- **Files Modified:**
  - `Supabase/utils/storage.ts`:
    - Refactored Supabase admin client initialization. It's now centralized, ensures environment variables are loaded prior to client creation, and the client is initialized only once.
    - Corrected the `BucketCreationOptions` interface, specifically making the `public` property a non-optional boolean to align with Supabase types and fix a lint error.
  - `Supabase/utils/test-read-storage.ts`:
    - Updated to utilize the exported helper functions (`initializeSupabaseAdmin`, `getStorageBuckets`, `getBucketObjects`) from `storage.ts`.
    - Eliminated direct dependency on the non-exported `supabaseAdmin` instance.
    - Resolved TypeScript lint errors, including module import issues and an implicit 'any' type for an iterated item.
    - Improved final console output to more accurately reflect success or failure based on caught errors.

## Environment Variable Loading Troubleshooting (Supabase Scripts)

- **Problem:** The `Supabase/utils/test-read-storage.ts` script, when executed with `npx tsx ./Supabase/utils/test-read-storage.ts`, was consistently failing to load essential environment variables (like `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`) from the `.env.local` file located in the project root. This occurred even though the `.env.local` file was correctly formatted and present.
- **Diagnostics:**
  - Initial checks in `storage.ts` showed that `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL_loaded` and `process.env.SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY_loaded` were `false`.
  - Added direct `console.log(process.env.VARIABLE_NAME)` statements at the very beginning of `test-read-storage.ts`. These also printed `undefined` for the critical variables, confirming the issue was with the variables not being available in the Node.js `process.env` object early in the script's lifecycle.
  - The current working directory (`process.cwd()`) was correctly reported as the project root, where `.env.local` resides.
- **Solution:**
  - Installed `dotenv` as a development dependency: `npm install dotenv --save-dev`.
  - Explicitly imported and configured `dotenv` at the very top of `Supabase/utils/test-read-storage.ts` by adding the line: `import 'dotenv/config';`.
- **Outcome:**
  - After this explicit import, the diagnostic logs in `test-read-storage.ts` immediately showed that the environment variables were being correctly loaded into `process.env`.
  - Consequently, the Supabase admin client in `storage.ts` initialized successfully.
  - The `test-read-storage.ts` script could then proceed to list Supabase storage buckets as intended.
- **Conclusion:** For standalone Node.js scripts executed with `tsx` in this project, relying on automatic loading of `.env.local` variables was not sufficient. Explicitly importing `dotenv/config` at the script's entry point ensures reliable environment variable loading. This practice should be adopted for other similar utility scripts if they depend on `.env` variables.

## Image Generation Batch Processing - CSV to Images (Ongoing)

- **Status:** In Progress
- **Tasks:**
  - [x] CSV Data Processing Script (`src/lib/csv-processor.ts`)
    - [x] Load CSV data from specified path.
    - [x] Parse CSV rows into structured objects.
    - [x] Validate required columns (e.g., `image_prompt`, `image_filename`).
    - [x] Handle potential errors during parsing (missing file, incorrect format).
  - [ ] Image Generation Service Integration (`src/lib/image-generator.ts`)
    - [ ] Implement function to call Vertex AI image generation API.
    - [ ] Handle API authentication and authorization (using service account key).
    - [ ] Manage API request/response cycle, including error handling (quota limits, API errors).
    - [ ] Allow specifying image dimensions, model, and other parameters.
  - [ ] Batch Processing Orchestration Script (`src/scripts/batch-image-generator.ts`)
    - [ ] Combine CSV processing and image generation.
    - [ ] Iterate over CSV data, generate images for each valid entry.
    - [ ] Save generated images to a specified output directory (`public/generated-images/`).
    - [ ] Implement progress logging and error reporting for the batch process.
  - [ ] Configuration File for Batch Process (`config/image-batch-config.json`)
    - [ ] Define input CSV path, output directory, Vertex AI model details, default image dimensions.
  - [ ] README/Documentation for running the batch process.
    - [ ] Instructions on setting up environment variables (`GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`, etc.).
    - [ ] Command to run the batch script.
    - [ ] Expected output and troubleshooting tips.
  - [ ] Testing
    - [ ] Unit tests for CSV parser.
    - [ ] Integration test for a single image generation call.
    - [ ] End-to-end test with a small sample CSV.
- **Notes:**
  - User to confirm `.env.local` file is correctly set up with Supabase credentials.
  - Re-run `test-read-storage.ts` script after environment variables are confirmed.

## 2025-05-18 - Vertex AI Integration Refactor & Test Script Fix

**Feature/Module:** Vertex AI Integration (`Relume-root/src/lib/vertex-ai/`)

**Changes Implemented:**

1. **Refactored Service Initialization:**

* Modified `VertexAIServiceAccount` (`service-account.ts`) and `VertexAIImageService` (`image-service.ts`) to use dynamic `import()` for Google Cloud SDKs (`@google-cloud/vertexai`, `google-auth-library`).
* Implemented an asynchronous static factory pattern (`async static create()`) in both services to handle the Promise-based nature of dynamic imports and ensure SDKs are loaded only when an instance is created.
* Made constructors private to enforce the use of the async factory methods.

1. **Resolved `ERR_REQUIRE_CYCLE_MODULE` in Test Script:**

* The `test-image-generation.ts` script was consistently failing with `ERR_REQUIRE_CYCLE_MODULE` when run with `ts-node` in an ESM project, likely due to complexities in `ts-node`'s ESM loader and CJS/ESM interop with Google SDKs on Node.js v22.
* **Solution:** Implemented a build step using `esbuild` to bundle `test-image-generation.ts` into a single JavaScript ESM file (`dist/test-image-generation.mjs`).
  * `esbuild` command: `npx esbuild Relume-root/src/lib/vertex-ai/test-image-generation.ts --bundle --outfile=dist/test-image-generation.mjs --platform=node --format=esm --external:dotenv --color=true`
  * The test script was modified to explicitly import `dotenv` and call `dotenv.config({ path: '.env.local', override: true });` to load environment variables. `dotenv` is marked as external for `esbuild` to use the runtime version from `node_modules`.
* **Run command for bundled test script:** `node --no-warnings dist/test-image-generation.mjs`

1. **Dependency Updates:**

* Added `esbuild` as a `devDependency`.
* Added `dotenv` as a regular `dependency` (as it's now imported by the test script directly).

1. **Configuration:**

* Updated `.gitignore` to exclude the `dist/` directory.
* Modified type imports in `service-account.ts` and `image-service.ts` from `@/*` aliases to relative paths to simplify `esbuild` setup.

**Outcome:**

The `test-image-generation.ts` script now runs successfully, validating the Vertex AI image generation flow from initialization to image creation. The core module loading errors have been resolved for this test scenario.

## 2025-05-18 - Vertex AI Image Generation - Persistent Quota Issues

* **Status:** Blocked
* **Feature/Module:** Vertex AI Image Generation (`Relume-root/src/lib/vertex-ai/test-image-generation.ts`)
* **Issue:** Consistently encountering `HTTP 429 Too Many Requests` errors when attempting to generate images using various Imagen 3 models (`imagen-3.0-generate-002`, `imagen-3.0-generate-001`, etc.) and the default `imagegeneration` model.
* **Details:**
  * Errors indicate quota exhaustion for `aiplatform.googleapis.com/generate_content_requests_per_minute_per_project_per_base_model`.
  * The specific "base model" cited in error messages varies (e.g., `imagen-3.0-generate`, `imagegeneration`, `imagen-3.0-fast-generate`), even when a specific Imagen 3 model like `imagen-3.0-generate-002` was set in the script.
  * Google Cloud Console showed 0% quota usage for key Imagen 3 models at one point (approx. 19:42), but subsequent attempts (approx. 19:45) still failed with 429 errors, with the API error log surprisingly citing the `imagegeneration` base model as the one exceeding quota.
* **Impact:** Unable to test or proceed with Vertex AI image generation features.
* **Next Steps:**
  1. Further waiting for quota reset (longer period suggested).
  1. Testing Vertex AI text generation to isolate if the quota issue is image-specific.
  1. Potential need to request a quota increase from Google Cloud if issues persist after sufficient waiting.

## 2025-05-19 - Relume-root Development Environment Setup

**Feature/Module:** Development Environment Setup (`Relume-root`)

**Changes Implemented:**

1. **Dependency Management:**
    *Confirmed `yarn install` completed successfully within the `c:\Users\IvoD\repos\react-win-dir\Relume-root` directory.
    *Removed `package-lock.json` from `Relume-root` to prevent potential conflicts with `yarn.lock` and ensure Yarn is the sole package manager for this directory.
2. **Development Server:**
    *Identified the `dev` script (`next dev -p 3000`) in `Relume-root/package.json`.
    *Successfully started the Next.js development server using `yarn dev` from the `Relume-root` directory.
    *Confirmed the server is running and accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

**Outcome:**

The development environment for the `Relume-root` portion of the project is now operational. The Next.js application can be accessed and tested locally.

## 2025-05-19 - Vertex AI Image Generation Issues & Workflow Pivot

* **Issue**: Persistent Vertex AI Image Generation Failures
* **Details**: Encountered consistent HTTP 429 'Too Many Requests' errors when attempting to use Vertex AI for image generation. This specifically affected:
  * Project: `windows-doors-website-dir-v2`
  * Region: `us-west1`
  * Models: `imagen-3.0-generate` (and variants like `-001`, `-002`, `fast-generate-001`) and the default `imagegeneration` model.
  * Error Message Snippet: 'Quota exceeded for aiplatform.googleapis.com/generate_content_requests_per_minute_per_project_per_base_model'.
* **Impact**: Blocked image generation capabilities for the project via Vertex AI.
* **Decision**: Pivoting to a workflow using local sample images stored in `c:\Users\IvoD\repos\react-win-dir\sample-images` (with `windows` and `doors` subfolders). These images will serve as placeholders and will be uploaded to Supabase Storage. Tagging and metadata management will also be handled via Supabase.
* **Status**: Vertex AI image generation is on hold. Implementing local sample image workflow.

## 2025-05-19 - Supabase Directory Structure Refactor

**Feature/Module:** Supabase Integration

**Changes Implemented:**

1. **Directory Move:**
   * Moved the `Supabase` directory from the project root (`c:\Users\IvoD\repos\react-win-dir\Supabase`) to `c:\Users\IvoD\repos\react-win-dir\Relume-root\Supabase\`.
   * This change centralizes Supabase-related code within the `Relume-root` structure.
2. **Memory Updates:**
   * Updated relevant memories (e.g., for test scripts `test-db-connection.ts` and `test-read-storage.ts`) to reflect the new paths.

**Outcome:**

Supabase-related utilities and configurations are now located under `Relume-root/Supabase/`. This improves project organization. Further checks will be performed to ensure all internal references are updated.

**Next Steps:**

1. Scan codebase for any hardcoded paths or import statements referencing the old `Supabase/` location and update them.

## Feature: Vertex AI Text Generation Setup

* **Date Implemented:** 2025-05-18
* **Status:** Completed
* **Description:**
  * Created a new `VertexAITextService` in `Relume-root/src/lib/vertex-ai/text-service.ts` for generating text using Google Cloud Vertex AI (Gemini models).
  * The service utilizes environment variables for secure credential management (`GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`) and GCP configuration (`GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT`, `GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION`).
  * Created `Relume-root/src/types/vertex-ai-types.ts` for future Vertex AI-related type definitions.
  * Created `Relume-root/src/lib/vertex-ai/index.ts` to centralize exports of Vertex AI services.
  * Refactored the existing test script `Relume-root/src/lib/vertex-ai/test-text-generation.ts` to use the new `VertexAITextService`, ensuring consistent and secure practices.
  * Updated build command in test script comments for accuracy.
  * Added `/output/` directory (where test results are saved) to `.gitignore`.
  * Successfully tested with `gemini-2.0-flash` model.
* **Files Modified/Created:**
  * `Relume-root/src/lib/vertex-ai/text-service.ts` (Created)
  * `Relume-root/src/types/vertex-ai-types.ts` (Created)
  * `Relume-root/src/lib/vertex-ai/index.ts` (Created)
  * `Relume-root/src/lib/vertex-ai/test-text-generation.ts` (Modified)
  * `.gitignore` (Modified)
  * `docs/tracking/tracking-progress.md` (Modified)

## 2025-05-20 - Vertex AI Text Generation Tests

* **Feature**: Vertex AI Integration - Text Generation
* **Details**: Successfully conducted text generation tests using Google Cloud Vertex AI.
  * **Model Used**: `gemini-2.0-flash` (confirmed working in `us-west1` for project `windows-doors-website-dir-v2`).
  * **Script**: `Relume-root/src/lib/vertex-ai/test-text-generation.ts`.
  * **Outcome**: Successfully generated text for 5 consecutive prompts without hitting quota limits. This indicates text generation capabilities are currently functional.
  * **Previous Issues Resolved**: Cleared up confusion regarding model availability (e.g., `gemini-1.0-pro` resulted in a 404 error). Ensured build process correctly picks up script changes.
  * **Note**: Image generation via Vertex AI (`imagen-3.0-generate` models) remains blocked by quota limits (`429 Too Many Requests`).
* **Status**: Text generation testing successful. Image generation blocked.

## 2025-05-20 - Supabase README Linting and Formatting

**Feature/Module:** Supabase Integration Documentation (`Relume-root/Supabase/README.md`)

**Changes Implemented:**

1. **Markdown Linting:**
    * Systematically addressed and resolved multiple markdown linting errors in `Relume-root/Supabase/README.md`.
    * Corrected issues related to `MD009` (no-trailing-spaces), `MD012` (no-multiple-blanks), `MD022` (headers should be surrounded by blank lines), `MD029` (ordered list item prefix), `MD030` (spaces after list markers), and `MD031` (fenced code blocks should be surrounded by blank lines).
2. **Whitespace Cleanup:**
    * Removed numerous instances of trailing non-breaking spaces (U+00A0) and excessive blank lines that were causing lint errors and affecting readability.
3. **Formatting:**
    * Ensured proper indentation for code blocks within ordered lists.
    * Standardized spacing around headings, paragraphs, and code blocks.

**Outcome:**

The `Relume-root/Supabase/README.md` file is now free of markdown lint errors and has improved formatting for better clarity and maintainability.
