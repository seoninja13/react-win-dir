## Overview

This document tracks the progress of implementing the Google Cloud Vertex AI integration for image generation. The goal is to automatically generate high-quality, consistent images for the Windows Doors CA website based on data from the Window World LA website.

## Implementation Status

**Current Status**: In Progress - API Integration Testing  
**Start Date**: 2025-05-15  
**Target Completion Date**: 2025-05-30  
**Priority**: High  
**Assigned To**: Development Team  
**Latest Update**: Found working implementation using direct REST API approach with gemini-2.0-flash model

## Technical Implementation

### Core Components

1. **Vertex AI Client Utility** (`Supabase/utils/vertex-ai-client.ts`)

   - Handles communication with Google Cloud Vertex AI
   - Provides functions for generating content and images
   - Supports multiple image generation models
   - Includes error handling and retry logic

2. **Logger Utility** (`Supabase/utils/logger.ts`)
   - Provides structured logging to Supabase
   - Supports multiple log levels (error, warning, info, debug)
   - Captures detailed error context
   - Enables centralized error tracking and monitoring

3. **Image Display Component** (`src/components/GeneratedImageDisplay.tsx`)
   - Displays images from Supabase storage
   - Handles loading and error states
   - Provides fallback options
   - Optimizes image display with Next.js Image component

### Processing Scripts

1. **CSV Processing Script** (`Supabase/scripts/process-image-csv.ts`)
   - Processes CSV data from Window World LA
   - Maps URLs between sites
   - Categorizes entries by page and image type
   - Enhances prompts for better results
   - Generates structured data for batch processing
   - Logs errors and progress to Supabase

2. **Test Batch Script** (`Supabase/scripts/test-batch-generate-images.ts`)
   - Processes a small batch of 5 images
   - Generates images using Vertex AI
   - Saves images to Supabase storage
   - Logs detailed results and errors to Supabase
   - Creates structured report for analysis

3. **Review Utility** (`Supabase/scripts/review-generated-images.ts`)
   - Creates HTML page for reviewing generated images
   - Displays images with metadata
   - Shows prompts and results
   - Provides summary of generation results
   - Logs review process to Supabase
   - Helps with quality assurance

## Testing Results

### Test Batch Results

The test batch processing is currently in progress. Initial results will be documented here once available.

### Prompt Engineering Findings

Initial prompt engineering findings:

- Adding style consistency elements improves results
- Including specific details about materials and colors helps
- Negative prompting helps avoid common issues
- Aspect ratio specification is important for consistent results

## Integration Status

The integration with the website is pending successful completion of the test batch processing. Once the test batch is approved, we will begin integrating the generated images into the website components.
