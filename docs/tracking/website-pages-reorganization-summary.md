## Overview

This document summarizes the ongoing reorganization of page-specific folders in the Relume-root directory. The reorganization involves physically moving all page-specific folders into the 'Website Pages' directory, replacing the previous approach of using junction points (symbolic links). This process is currently in progress, with comprehensive documentation updates completed and folder moving underway.

## Changes Made

### 1. Documentation Updates (Completed)

- Updated `project-structure-current-state.md` to reflect the new organization
- Updated `website-pages-organization.md` to document the new physical organization
- Updated the architecture index to include the new documentation
- Updated the main documentation index to reference the updated documentation
- Created a daily log for the reorganization work
- Created tracking documents for the reorganization process

### 2. Implementation Planning (Completed)

- Created a detailed plan for moving page-specific folders
- Identified all folders that need to be moved (50+ folders)
- Created a test plan to verify functionality after the reorganization
- Prepared for manual folder moving process

### 3. Folder Structure Changes (In Progress)

- Created the Website Pages directory
- Started the process of manually moving page-specific folders
- Currently in progress - moving folders one by one to ensure proper organization

### 4. Import Path Updates (Pending)

- Will update import paths in src/app pages after folder moving is complete
- Will systematically update all references to the moved folders

## Benefits

The reorganization of page-specific folders provides several benefits:

1. **Improved Organization**: All page-specific components are now physically centralized in one location
2. **Cleaner Root Directory**: The Relume-root directory is less cluttered and easier to navigate
3. **Consistent Structure**: All page-specific components follow a consistent organizational pattern
4. **Improved Maintainability**: The project structure is more intuitive and easier to maintain

## Next Steps

The following steps should be taken to complete the reorganization process:

1. **Complete Folder Moving**: Finish moving all 50+ page-specific folders to the Website Pages directory
2. **Update Import Paths**: Systematically update all import paths in src/app pages to point to the new locations
3. **Comprehensive Testing**: Test all pages to ensure they work correctly with the new folder structure
4. **Fix Any Issues**: Address any issues discovered during testing
5. **Documentation Refinement**: Further refine documentation based on the completed reorganization
6. **Developer Onboarding**: Update onboarding documentation to reflect the new structure
