## Google GenAI SDK Implementation

### Implementation Progress

1. **New @google/genai SDK Testing**
   - Created test scripts for the new `@google/genai` SDK (v0.14.1)
   - Tested both Google AI Studio and Vertex AI authentication methods
   - Implemented comprehensive error handling and diagnostics
   - Created detailed documentation in `docs/Image generation/google-genai-sdk-implementation.md`

2. **Authentication Testing**
   - Tested Google AI Studio API key authentication (encountered 401 Unauthorized)
   - Tested Vertex AI with Application Default Credentials
   - Tested Vertex AI with service account authentication
   - Created API key verification script

3. **Rate Limiting Implementation**
   - Implemented conservative rate limiting (10 req/min instead of 50)
   - Added exponential backoff for retries
   - Added initial delay to avoid quota issues
   - Documented approach in `docs/Image generation/implementation-updates-2025-05-16.md`

### Challenges Encountered

1. **API Key Authentication Issues**
   - Google AI Studio API key returned 401 Unauthorized errors
   - Need to generate a new API key from Google AI Studio

2. **Quota Limitations**
   - Vertex AI image generation hit quota limits
   - Error: "Quota exceeded for aiplatform.googleapis.com/generate_content_requests_per_minute_per_project_per_base_model"

3. **Model Availability**
   - Some models weren't available in certain regions
   - Implemented region and model fallback mechanisms

### Next Steps

1. **Generate New API Key**
   - Create a new API key from Google AI Studio
   - Update `.env.local` with the new key

2. **Implement Production-Ready Rate Limiting**
   - Add conservative rate limiting for Vertex AI
   - Monitor quota usage in Google Cloud Console
   - Request quota increase if needed for production use

3. **Integration**
   - Connect the new SDK with the existing batch processing system
   - Integrate with frontend components

## Google Generative AI Integration

### Implementation Progress

1. **Supabase Storage Integration**
   - Created utilities for uploading images to Supabase Storage
   - Implemented bucket management functions
   - Fixed permissions issues by using the service role key
   - Successfully tested CRUD operations with Supabase Storage

2. **Vertex AI Integration**
   - Implemented utilities for generating images using the Vertex AI API
   - Configured to use the `imagen-3.0-fast-generate-001` model
   - Set up proper error handling and logging
   - Created test scripts for verifying the integration

3. **Batch Processing**
   - Created a batch processing utility for CSV data
   - Implemented test scripts for processing a small batch of 5 images
   - Encountered quota limits with the Google Cloud project
   - Documented findings and next steps in `Docs/Image generation/test-batch-results.md`

### Next Steps

1. **Resolve Quota Issues**
   - Request a quota increase for the Vertex AI API in the Google Cloud Console
   - Implement rate limiting to stay within quota limits

2. **Complete Test Batch**
   - Run the test batch with 5 images once quota issues are resolved
   - Verify proper storage in Supabase

3. **Scale Up**
   - Process the full CSV file with batching to avoid quota limits
