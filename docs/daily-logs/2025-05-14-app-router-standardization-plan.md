# Daily Log: App Router Standardization Plan

**Topic**: App Router Standardization Plan
**Priority**: 1 (Critical)

## Overview

Today, we created a comprehensive plan for standardizing the project on the Next.js App Router approach while keeping all files within the `Relume-root` directory structure. This plan addresses the current mixed routing approach and establishes a consistent project structure.

## Background

As of May 13, 2025, the project has decided to standardize on the Next.js App Router approach for all routing and page implementation. However, the current project structure contains a mix of:

1. Pages Router files in `Relume-root/pages/`
2. App Router files in `src/app/`
3. App Router files in `Relume-root/src/app/`

This mixed approach has led to routing conflicts, confusing import paths, and development challenges. The plan aims to consolidate all routing under the App Router approach while keeping everything within the `Relume-root` directory structure.

## Key Decisions

1. **Standardize on App Router**: We will exclusively use the Next.js App Router for all routing and page implementation.
2. **Keep Everything in Relume-root**: All files will be kept within the `Relume-root` directory structure.
3. **Remove Pages Router Files**: We will remove all Pages Router files that have corresponding App Router implementations.
4. **Update Configuration Files**: We will update all configuration files to support the consolidated structure.

## Implementation Plan

The implementation plan consists of seven phases:

1. **Preparation and Analysis**: Document the current structure, identify configuration files to update, and create backups.
2. **Update Configuration Files**: Update Tailwind, TypeScript, and Next.js configuration files.
3. **Migrate Pages**: Migrate pages from `src/app` to `Relume-root/src/app`.
4. **Update Import Paths**: Update import paths in App Router pages and components.
5. **Remove Duplicate Pages Router Files**: Remove conflicting Pages Router files.
6. **Testing and Verification**: Test the development server, navigation, and components.
7. **Documentation**: Update documentation to reflect the new structure.

## Implementation Schedule

As a **Priority 1 (Critical)** task, implementation should begin immediately:

- **Start Date**: May 15, 2025 (immediately following approval of this plan)
- **Completion Date**: May 22, 2025 (estimated)

### Phase Timeline:
- **Phase 1-2**: 1 day (May 15, 2025)
- **Phase 3-4**: 2-3 days (May 16-18, 2025)
- **Phase 5**: 1 day (May 19, 2025)
- **Phase 6**: 1-2 days (May 20-21, 2025)
- **Phase 7**: 1 day (May 22, 2025)

### Key Milestones:
- **Milestone 1**: Configuration files updated (End of Phase 2)
- **Milestone 2**: All pages migrated to Relume-root/src/app (End of Phase 4)
- **Milestone 3**: All conflicting Pages Router files removed (End of Phase 5)
- **Milestone 4**: All pages tested and verified (End of Phase 6)
- **Milestone 5**: Documentation updated (End of Phase 7)

## Risks and Mitigation

We identified several risks and mitigation strategies:

1. **Import Path Errors**: Test each page after updating imports.
2. **Component Compatibility**: Test components thoroughly and fix issues as they arise.
3. **Styling Issues**: Update Tailwind configuration and test styling.
4. **Routing Conflicts**: Remove all Pages Router files for routes that have App Router implementations.

## Documentation Updates

We created and updated the following documentation:

1. **App Router Standardization Plan**: Created a comprehensive plan for standardizing on the App Router approach.
2. **Documentation Map**: Updated to include the App Router Standardization Plan.
3. **Documentation Index**: Updated to include the App Router Standardization Plan.

## Next Steps

As a Priority 1 (Critical) task, implementation should begin immediately:

1. **Immediate Action (May 15, 2025)**: Begin implementing Phase 1 (Preparation and Analysis) and Phase 2 (Update Configuration Files).
2. **Daily Progress Tracking**: Update the daily logs with progress and any issues encountered at the end of each day.
3. **Milestone Verification**: Verify each milestone is completed before proceeding to the next phase.
4. **Team Communication**: Ensure all team members are aware of the ongoing implementation and potential impacts on development.
5. **Pause Other Development**: Consider pausing other development activities until the routing structure is standardized to prevent further conflicts.

## Conclusion

The App Router Standardization Plan provides a detailed roadmap for standardizing on the App Router approach while keeping all files within the `Relume-root` directory structure. By following this plan, we will create a consistent project structure that follows Next.js best practices and makes future development easier.
