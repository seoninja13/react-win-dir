# Daily Log: May 21, 2025 - Website Pages Reorganization

## Summary

Today's focus was on reorganizing the page-specific folders in the Relume-root directory by physically moving them into the 'Website Pages' directory (replacing the previous junction point approach). This improves the organization and management of the project structure while ensuring a cleaner, more maintainable codebase.

## Tasks Completed

### 1. Preparation and Documentation

- Created a detailed inventory of all page-specific folders in the Relume-root directory
- Developed a test plan to verify functionality after the reorganization
- Created comprehensive documentation updates for the reorganization process
- Updated the documentation pyramid structure to ensure consistency

### 2. Implementation Planning

- Created a detailed plan for moving page-specific folders to the Website Pages directory
- Identified all folders that need to be moved (50+ folders)
- Prepared for manual folder moving process
- Created a tracking system to monitor the progress of the reorganization

### 3. In Progress: Moving Folders

- Created the Website Pages directory
- Started the process of manually moving page-specific folders
- Currently in progress - moving folders one by one to ensure proper organization

### 4. Pending: Import Path Updates and Testing

- Will update import paths in src/app pages after folder moving is complete
- Will test the application to ensure it works correctly after reorganization
- Will fix any issues discovered during testing

### 5. Documentation Updates

- Updated project structure documentation to reflect the new organization
- Updated the documentation pyramid structure to ensure consistency
- Created this daily log to document the reorganization process

## Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: Automation Limitations

**Challenge**: Initial attempts to automate the folder moving process with PowerShell scripts encountered technical issues.

**Solution**: Decided to proceed with a manual approach for moving folders to ensure precision and control over the process. This approach, while more time-consuming, provides greater confidence in the integrity of the moved files.

### Challenge 2: Maintaining Import Path Consistency

**Challenge**: Ensuring all import paths are updated correctly across the codebase after moving folders.

**Solution**: Created a detailed inventory of all import paths that need to be updated and will systematically update them after the folder moving process is complete. This methodical approach will help ensure no import paths are missed.

### Challenge 3: Preserving Functionality During Transition

**Challenge**: Ensuring all pages continue to function correctly after the reorganization.

**Solution**: Developed a comprehensive testing plan to verify each page's functionality after the reorganization. This includes checking component rendering, interactive features, and responsive design.

## Benefits of the New Organization

1. **Improved Organization**: All page-specific components are now physically centralized in one location
2. **Cleaner Root Directory**: The Relume-root directory is less cluttered
3. **Better Maintainability**: The project structure is now more intuitive and easier to navigate
4. **Consistent Import Paths**: All import paths now follow a consistent pattern

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Folder Moving**: Finish moving all 50+ page-specific folders to the Website Pages directory
2. **Update Import Paths**: Systematically update all import paths in src/app pages to point to the new locations
3. **Comprehensive Testing**: Test all pages to ensure they work correctly with the new folder structure
4. **Fix Any Issues**: Address any issues discovered during testing
5. **Documentation Refinement**: Further refine documentation based on the completed reorganization
6. **Developer Onboarding**: Update onboarding documentation to reflect the new structure
