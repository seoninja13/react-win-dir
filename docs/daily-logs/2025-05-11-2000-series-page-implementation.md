# 2000-Series Page Implementation

**Date:** 2025-05-11

## Overview

This document details the implementation of the 2000-series vinyl siding page for the Windows Doors CA website. The page follows the T3 (Product/Service Detail Page) template as specified in the architecture documentation.

## Implementation Process

1. Created the route for the 2000-series page in the Pages Router:
   ```javascript
   // Relume-root/pages/2000-series.js
   export { default } from '../2000-series';
   ```

2. Verified the existence of the 2000-series component directory and files:
   - Confirmed the 2000-series/index.jsx file exists
   - Confirmed the components directory with all required components exists

3. Encountered an error when loading the page:
   ```
   Error: Element type is invalid: expected a string (for built-in components) or a class/function (for composite components) but got: undefined. You likely forgot to export your component from the file it's defined in, or you might have mixed up default and named imports.
   ```

4. Identified the issue in the Faq5.jsx component:
   - The component was importing a `Card` component from the Relume UI library that wasn't available
   - Error message: `Attempted import error: 'Card' is not exported from '@relume_io/relume-ui' (imported as 'Card')`

5. Fixed the issue by:
   - Removing the `Card` import from the Faq5.jsx component
   - Replacing `<Card>` elements with styled `<div>` elements to maintain the same visual appearance
   - Modified code:
   ```jsx
   // Before
   <Card>
     <AccordionItem value="item-0" className="border-none px-5 md:px-6">
       ...
     </AccordionItem>
   </Card>
   
   // After
   <div className="border rounded-md shadow-sm">
     <AccordionItem value="item-0" className="border-none px-5 md:px-6">
       ...
     </AccordionItem>
   </div>
   ```

6. Successfully loaded the 2000-series page at http://localhost:3007/2000-series

## Lessons Learned

1. The Relume UI library doesn't export a `Card` component, but we can achieve the same visual effect using styled `div` elements.
2. When encountering component errors, check the server logs for detailed error messages that point to the specific component and issue.
3. Reference working components (like those in the garden page) to understand the correct implementation pattern.

## Next Steps

1. Continue implementing the remaining vinyl siding series pages (3000-series, etc.)
2. Ensure consistent styling and functionality across all product detail pages
3. Verify all components are properly importing from the Relume UI library
