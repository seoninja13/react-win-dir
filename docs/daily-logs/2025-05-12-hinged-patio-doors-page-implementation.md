**Author:** Augment Agent  
**Task:** Implement the hinged patio doors page

## Overview

This document details the implementation of the hinged patio doors page for the Windows Doors CA website. The hinged patio doors page showcases hinged patio door products, their features, benefits, and design options.

## Implementation Details

The hinged patio doors page was successfully implemented by creating a route file that points to the existing hinged-patio-doors page component. The implementation was straightforward as the hinged-patio-doors directory and components already existed in the Relume-root directory.

### Implementation Steps

1. Verified that the hinged-patio-doors page directory and components already existed in the Relume-root directory
2. Created a route file at `Relume-root/pages/hinged-patio-doors.js` with the following content:
   ```javascript
   export { default } from '../hinged-patio-doors';
   ```
3. Tested the page by opening it in the browser at http://localhost:3000/hinged-patio-doors
4. Confirmed that the page rendered correctly with all components

### Directory Structure

The hinged patio doors page follows the standard directory structure for product pages:

```
hinged-patio-doors/
├── components/
│   ├── [Component files]
└── index.jsx
```

## Issues and Solutions

No issues were encountered during the implementation of the hinged patio doors page. The implementation was straightforward because:

1. The hinged-patio-doors page directory and components already existed in the Relume-root directory
2. We followed the established pattern for creating route files
3. We verified that the page exists in the Relume-DO-NOT-EDIT directory before implementing it

## Lessons Learned

1. **Verify Existing Components**: Always check if the page directory and components already exist in the Relume-root directory before creating new ones.
2. **Follow Established Patterns**: Follow the patterns established in existing, working pages for creating route files.
3. **Check Original Structure**: Always verify that the page exists in the Relume-DO-NOT-EDIT directory before implementing it.

## Next Steps

1. Update the webpage progress tracker to include the hinged patio doors page
2. Create documentation for the hinged patio doors page
3. Continue with implementing the remaining pages from the Relume-DO-NOT-EDIT directory

## Conclusion

The hinged patio doors page has been successfully implemented and is working as expected. The implementation was straightforward, with no issues encountered.
