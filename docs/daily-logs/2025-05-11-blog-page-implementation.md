# Daily Log: May 11, 2025 - Blog Page Implementation

## Summary

Today's focus was on implementing and testing the Blog page for the Windows Doors CA website. The Blog page is a blog list/archive page template (T5 template) that provides a listing of blog posts with featured posts, categories, and pagination.

## Tasks Completed

### 1. Blog Page Implementation

- Created a route for the Blog page at `/blog` path
- Verified that all components in the Blog page are working correctly
- Tested the Blog page to ensure it renders correctly
- Confirmed that there are no Card component issues in the Blog page components

### 2. Documentation Updates

- Updated the Webpage Progress Tracker to reflect the completion of the Blog page
- Updated the T5 template status to "Complete"
- Created this daily log entry to document the implementation process

## Implementation Details

### Route Creation

Created a route for the Blog page by adding a new file at `Relume-root/pages/blog.js` that exports the Blog component:

```javascript
export { default } from '../blog';
```

### Component Structure

The Blog page consists of the following components:

1. Navbar10 - Navigation bar component
2. Header46 - Main header component
3. Header26 - Secondary header component
4. Layout4 - Content layout component
5. Blog34 - Blog listing component
6. Layout12 - Content layout component
7. Layout1 - Content layout component
8. Layout10 - Content layout component
9. Footer4 - Footer component

All components were verified to be working correctly without any Card component issues that we encountered in previous pages.

### Testing

After implementing the route, we tested the Blog page by:

1. Opening the page in the browser at http://localhost:3002/blog
2. Checking the console for any errors
3. Verifying that the page renders correctly with all components

## Issues Encountered

No significant issues were encountered during the implementation of the Blog page. Unlike the Windows and Installation pages, the Blog page did not have any Card component issues that needed to be fixed.

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Testing**: Continue testing the Blog page to ensure all components render correctly and all functionality works as expected.

2. **Implement Internal Links**: Implement and test all internal links on the Blog page.

3. **Rail Room Integration**: Complete the integration with Rail Room for the Blog page.

4. **Blog Post Implementation**: Implement the Blog Post page (T6 template) to complete the blog functionality.

5. **Documentation**: Create detailed documentation for the Blog page, including component structure, content, and functionality.
