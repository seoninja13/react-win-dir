# Daily Log: May 11, 2025 - FAQ Page Implementation

## Summary

Today's focus was on implementing and testing the FAQ page for the Windows Doors CA website. The FAQ page is a FAQ page template (T9 template) that provides a list of frequently asked questions with accordion-style answers.

## Tasks Completed

### 1. FAQ Page Implementation

- Created a route for the FAQ page at `/faqs` path
- Verified that all components in the FAQ page are working correctly
- Tested the FAQ page to ensure it renders correctly
- Confirmed that there are no Card component issues in the FAQ page components

### 2. Documentation Updates

- Updated the Webpage Progress Tracker to reflect the completion of the FAQ page
- Updated the T9 template status to "Complete"
- Created this daily log entry to document the implementation process

## Implementation Details

### Route Creation

Created a route for the FAQ page by adding a new file at `Relume-root/pages/faqs.js` that exports the FAQ component:

```javascript
export { default } from '../faqs';
```

### Component Structure

The FAQ page consists of the following components:

1. Navbar10 - Navigation bar component
2. Header46 - Main header component
3. Header5 - Secondary header component
4. Layout3 - Content layout component
5. Faq1 - FAQ component with accordion-style questions and answers
6. Cta1 - Call to action component
7. Testimonial1 - Testimonial component
8. Layout12 - Content layout component
9. Footer4 - Footer component

All components were verified to be working correctly without any Card component issues that we encountered in previous pages.

### Testing

After implementing the route, we tested the FAQ page by:

1. Opening the page in the browser at http://localhost:3002/faqs
2. Checking the console for any errors
3. Verifying that the page renders correctly with all components

## Issues Encountered

No significant issues were encountered during the implementation of the FAQ page. Unlike the Windows and Installation pages, the FAQ page did not have any Card component issues that needed to be fixed.

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Testing**: Continue testing the FAQ page to ensure all components render correctly and all functionality works as expected.

2. **Implement Internal Links**: Implement and test all internal links on the FAQ page.

3. **Rail Room Integration**: Complete the integration with Rail Room for the FAQ page.

4. **Dynamic Content**: Implement dynamic content loading for FAQ questions and answers from the database.

5. **Documentation**: Create detailed documentation for the FAQ page, including component structure, content, and functionality.
