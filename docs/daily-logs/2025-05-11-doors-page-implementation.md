# Daily Log: May 11, 2025 - Doors Page Implementation

## Summary

Today's focus was on implementing and testing the Doors page for the Windows Doors CA website. The Doors page is a product/service category page template (T2 template) that provides an overview of door products, featured door types, benefits, and call-to-action sections.

## Tasks Completed

### 1. Doors Page Implementation

- Created a route for the Doors page at `/doors` path
- Verified that all components in the Doors page are working correctly
- Tested the Doors page to ensure it renders correctly
- Confirmed that there are no Card component issues in the Doors page components

### 2. Documentation Updates

- Created this daily log entry to document the implementation process

## Implementation Details

### Route Creation

Created a route for the Doors page by adding a new file at `Relume-root/pages/doors.js` that exports the Doors component:

```javascript
export { default } from '../doors';
```

### Component Structure

The Doors page consists of the following components:

1. Navbar10 - Navigation bar component
2. Header44 - Main header component
3. Header9 - Secondary header component
4. Layout101 - Content layout component
5. Layout4 - Content layout component
6. Layout25 - Content layout component
7. Layout101_1 - Content layout component
8. Layout16 - Content layout component
9. Cta25 - Call to action component
10. Testimonial4 - Testimonial component
11. Footer4 - Footer component

All components were verified to be working correctly without any Card component issues that we encountered in previous pages.

### Testing

After implementing the route, we tested the Doors page by:

1. Opening the page in the browser at http://localhost:3002/doors
2. Checking the console for any errors
3. Verifying that the page renders correctly with all components

## Issues Encountered

No significant issues were encountered during the implementation of the Doors page. Unlike the Windows and Installation pages, the Doors page did not have any Card component issues that needed to be fixed.

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Testing**: Continue testing the Doors page to ensure all components render correctly and all functionality works as expected.

2. **Implement Internal Links**: Implement and test all internal links on the Doors page.

3. **Rail Room Integration**: Complete the integration with Rail Room for the Doors page.

4. **Documentation**: Create detailed documentation for the Doors page, including component structure, content, and functionality.
