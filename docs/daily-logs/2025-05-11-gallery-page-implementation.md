# Daily Log: May 11, 2025 - Gallery Page Implementation

## Summary

Today's focus was on implementing and testing the Gallery page for the Windows Doors CA website. The Gallery page is a gallery page template (T8 template) that provides a filterable project showcase with images and testimonials.

## Tasks Completed

### 1. Gallery Page Implementation

- Created a route for the Gallery page at `/gallery` path
- Verified that all components in the Gallery page are working correctly
- Tested the Gallery page to ensure it renders correctly
- Confirmed that there are no Card component issues in the Gallery page components

### 2. Documentation Updates

- Updated the Webpage Progress Tracker to reflect the completion of the Gallery page
- Updated the T8 template status to "Complete"
- Created this daily log entry to document the implementation process

## Implementation Details

### Route Creation

Created a route for the Gallery page by adding a new file at `Relume-root/pages/gallery.js` that exports the Gallery component:

```javascript
export { default } from '../gallery';
```

### Component Structure

The Gallery page consists of the following components:

1. Navbar10 - Navigation bar component
2. Header46 - Main header component
3. Header5 - Secondary header component
4. Layout3 - Content layout component
5. Gallery2 - Gallery component with filterable project showcase
6. Cta1 - Call to action component
7. Testimonial1 - Testimonial component
8. Layout12 - Content layout component
9. Footer4 - Footer component

All components were verified to be working correctly without any Card component issues that we encountered in previous pages.

### Testing

After implementing the route, we tested the Gallery page by:

1. Opening the page in the browser at http://localhost:3002/gallery
2. Checking the console for any errors
3. Verifying that the page renders correctly with all components

## Issues Encountered

No significant issues were encountered during the implementation of the Gallery page. Unlike the Windows and Installation pages, the Gallery page did not have any Card component issues that needed to be fixed.

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Testing**: Continue testing the Gallery page to ensure all components render correctly and all functionality works as expected.

2. **Implement Internal Links**: Implement and test all internal links on the Gallery page.

3. **Rail Room Integration**: Complete the integration with Rail Room for the Gallery page.

4. **Dynamic Content**: Implement dynamic content loading for gallery images from the database.

5. **Documentation**: Create detailed documentation for the Gallery page, including component structure, content, and functionality.
