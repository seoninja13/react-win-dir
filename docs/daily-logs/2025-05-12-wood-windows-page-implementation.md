# Wood Windows Page Implementation

**Date:** May 12, 2025  
**Author:** Augment Agent  
**Task:** Implement the wood-windows page

## Overview

This document details the implementation of the wood-windows page for the Windows Doors CA website. The wood-windows page showcases wood window products, their features, benefits, and design options.

## Implementation Details

The wood-windows page was implemented by creating a route file that points to the existing wood-windows page component. The implementation required fixing issues with several components that were using Relume UI components that weren't properly configured.

### Implementation Steps

1. Verified that the wood-windows page directory and components already existed in the Relume-root directory
2. Confirmed that the wood-windows directory contained the necessary components, including:
   - index.jsx file
   - Various component files in the components directory
3. Created a route file at `Relume-root/pages/wood-windows.js` with the following content:
   ```javascript
   export { default } from '../wood-windows';
   ```
4. Tested the page by opening it in the browser at http://localhost:3000/wood-windows
5. Encountered errors with components using Button and Card components from @relume_io/relume-ui
6. Created custom implementations of these components:
   - CustomButton.jsx
   - CustomCard.jsx
7. Updated all components to use the custom implementations instead of the Relume UI components
8. Tested the page again and confirmed it was working correctly

### Directory Structure

The wood-windows page follows the standard directory structure for product pages:

```
wood-windows/
├── components/
│   ├── Cta1.jsx (modified)
│   ├── CustomButton.jsx (new)
│   ├── CustomCard.jsx (new)

## Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: Button Component Error

**Error Message**: 
```
Server Error
Error: Element type is invalid: expected a string (for built-in components) or a class/function (for composite components) but got: undefined. You likely forgot to export your component from the file it's defined in, or you might have mixed up default and named imports.
```

**Root Cause**: Several components were importing Button from @relume_io/relume-ui, but this component wasn't properly configured or available in the project.

**Solution**: 
1. Created a custom Button component (CustomButton.jsx) with the following code:
   ```jsx
   "use client";

   import React from "react";

   export function CustomButton({ 
     children, 
     variant = "primary", 
     size = "md", 
     className = "", 
     iconRight,
     onClick,
     ...props 
   }) {
     const getButtonClasses = () => {
       let baseClasses = "inline-flex items-center justify-center";
       
       // Size variants
       if (size === "sm") {
         baseClasses += " h-10 px-4 text-sm";
       } else if (size === "md") {
         baseClasses += " h-12 px-6";
       } else if (size === "lg") {
         baseClasses += " h-14 px-8 text-lg";
       } else if (size === "link") {
         baseClasses += " p-0";
       }
       
       // Style variants
       if (variant === "primary") {
         baseClasses += " rounded-lg bg-gray-800 text-center font-medium text-white transition-colors hover:bg-gray-900 focus-visible:outline-none focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-ring focus-visible:ring-offset-2 disabled:pointer-events-none disabled:opacity-50";
       } else if (variant === "secondary") {
         baseClasses += " rounded-lg border border-gray-800 bg-transparent text-center font-medium text-gray-800 transition-colors hover:bg-gray-100 focus-visible:outline-none focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-ring focus-visible:ring-offset-2 disabled:pointer-events-none disabled:opacity-50";
       } else if (variant === "link") {
         baseClasses += " text-gray-800 hover:underline";
       }
       
       return `${baseClasses} ${className}`;
     };
     
     return (
       <button className={getButtonClasses()} onClick={onClick} {...props}>
         {children}
         {iconRight && <span className="ml-2">{iconRight}</span>}
       </button>
     );
   }
   ```
2. Modified all components that were using the Relume UI Button component to use our custom implementation instead
3. Replaced all instances of Button with CustomButton in the following files:
   - Layout10.jsx
   - Layout10_1.jsx
   - Layout10_2.jsx
   - Layout1.jsx
   - Layout201.jsx
   - Layout249.jsx
   - Layout396.jsx
   - Cta1.jsx
   - Header5.jsx

### Issue 2: Card Component Error

**Error Message**: Similar to the Button component error, the Card component from @relume_io/relume-ui was also causing issues.

**Root Cause**: The Layout396.jsx component was importing Card from @relume_io/relume-ui, but this component wasn't properly configured or available in the project.

**Solution**: 
1. Created a custom Card component (CustomCard.jsx) with the following code:
   ```jsx
   "use client";

   import React from "react";

   export function CustomCard({ children, className = "", ...props }) {
     return (
       <div 
         className={`rounded-lg border border-gray-200 bg-white shadow-sm ${className}`}
         {...props}
       >
         {children}
       </div>
     );
   }
   ```
2. Modified the Layout396.jsx component to use our custom implementation instead
3. Replaced all instances of Card with CustomCard in the Layout396.jsx file

## Lessons Learned

1. **Check for Relume UI Component Usage**: Always check if components are using Relume UI components that might not be properly configured or available in the project.
2. **Custom Component Implementation**: When encountering issues with Relume UI components, create custom implementations using standard React patterns.
3. **Component Reuse**: Similar issues might occur with other components that use Relume UI components. The same approach can be used to fix those components.
4. **Thorough Testing**: Always test the page in the browser to ensure all components render correctly.

## Next Steps

1. Update the webpage progress tracker to include the wood-windows page
2. Create documentation for the wood-windows page
3. Check other pages for similar issues with Relume UI components
4. Continue with implementing the remaining pages from the Relume-DO-NOT-EDIT directory

## Conclusion

The wood-windows page has been successfully implemented and is working as expected. The issues with the Button and Card components have been resolved by creating custom implementations. This approach can be used for other components that encounter similar issues with Relume UI components.
