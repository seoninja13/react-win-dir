## Vertex AI Image Generation Troubleshooting

**Objective:** Successfully generate an image using Imagen 3 models via the `Relume-root/src/lib/vertex-ai/test-image-generation.ts` script.

**Attempts and Errors:**

*   **Initial Attempts (Imagen 3 Models):**
    *   Tried models: `imagen-3.0-generate`, `imagen-3.0-generate-002`, `imagen-3.0-generate-001`, `imagen-3.0-fast-generate-001`.
    *   Consistently received `HTTP 429 Too Many Requests` errors.
    *   Error details indicated quota exhaustion for `aiplatform.googleapis.com/generate_content_requests_per_minute_per_project_per_base_model` with varying "base model" identifiers in the error message (e.g., `imagen-3.0-generate`, `imagegeneration`, `imagen-3.0-fast-generate`).
*   **Attempt with Default Model:**
    *   Switched to `model: 'imagegeneration'` (default non-Imagen 3 model).
    *   Still received a `429 Too Many Requests` error, with the error detail pointing to `base model: imagegeneration` (and sometimes `imagen-3.0-fast-generate` in the log even when `imagegeneration` was specified in the script).
*   **Quota Console Discrepancy:**
    *   User checked Google Cloud Console quotas around 19:42.
    *   Console showed 0% current usage for `imagen-3.0-capability`, `imagen-3.0-fast-generate`, and `imagen-3.0-generate` (50 RPM limit each) in `us-west1`.
    *   Despite this, a subsequent attempt with `imagen-3.0-generate-002` (around 19:45) still resulted in a 429 error, with the error log referencing `base model: imagegeneration`.

**Current Hypothesis:**
The project is hitting a general Vertex AI image generation quota in `us-west1` that is either very quickly exhausted or the console display of available quota has a lag. The exact "base model" cited in 429 errors varies, suggesting a complex interplay or broad bucketing of quotas.

**Next Steps (from this log entry):**
1.  Wait for a longer period for quotas to fully reset.
2.  Attempt Vertex AI text generation to see if the quota issue is image-specific.
3.  If image generation quota issues persist, a Google Cloud quota increase request will be necessary.
