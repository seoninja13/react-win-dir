# Daily Log: May 24, 2025 - Doors Page App Router Implementation

## Summary

Today's focus was on implementing the Doors page in the App Router structure. This implementation is part of our complete migration from Pages Router to App Router architecture. The goal is to have all pages using only App Router routes, eventually removing all Pages Router implementations.

## Tasks Completed

### 1. Doors Page App Router Implementation

- Updated the existing App Router route file at `Relume-root/src/app/doors/page.tsx`
- Imported all the necessary components from the doors directory
- Added logging functionality to track page rendering
- Created a Pages Router implementation for backward compatibility
- Tested the page to ensure it works correctly

### 2. Implementation Details

The Doors page was implemented using the following approach:

1. Updated the App Router route at `Relume-root/src/app/doors/page.tsx` with the following content:
   ```tsx
   'use client';

   import React, { useEffect } from 'react';
   import { logger } from '@/utils/logger';

   // Import the Doors page components
   import { Navbar10 } from '../../../doors/components/Navbar10';
   import { Header44 } from '../../../doors/components/Header44';
   import { Header9 } from '../../../doors/components/Header9';
   import { Layout101 } from '../../../doors/components/Layout101';
   import { Layout4 } from '../../../doors/components/Layout4';
   import { Layout25 } from '../../../doors/components/Layout25';
   import { Layout101_1 } from '../../../doors/components/Layout101_1';
   import { Layout16 } from '../../../doors/components/Layout16';
   import { Cta25 } from '../../../doors/components/Cta25';
   import { Testimonial4 } from '../../../doors/components/Testimonial4';
   import { Footer4 } from '../../../doors/components/Footer4';

   export default function Doors() {
     useEffect(() => {
       // Log that the doors page has been rendered
       logger.info('Doors page rendered', {
         component: 'DoorsPage',
         timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
       });
     }, []);

     return (
       <div>
         <Navbar10 />
         <Header44 />
         <Header9 />
         <Layout101 />
         <Layout4 />
         <Layout25 />
         <Layout101_1 />
         <Layout16 />
         <Cta25 />
         <Testimonial4 />
         <Footer4 />
       </div>
     );
   }
   ```

2. Created a Pages Router implementation at `Relume-root/pages/doors.js` with the following content:
   ```javascript
   export { default } from '../doors';
   ```

3. Tested the page by accessing it directly via URL at `/doors`

## Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: Simplified Debug Version

**Issue Description**: The initial App Router implementation of the Doors page was a simplified debugging version, not the actual doors page from the Relume components.

**Root Cause**: The page was likely created as a temporary placeholder during the initial App Router migration.

**Solution**: Replaced the simplified version with the actual implementation that imports all the necessary components from the doors directory.

### Issue 2: PowerShell Command Syntax

**Issue Description**: When trying to restart the development server, the command failed due to incorrect PowerShell syntax.

**Root Cause**: Used `&&` for command chaining, which is not supported in PowerShell.

**Solution**: Used the semicolon (`;`) separator instead, which is the correct syntax for PowerShell.

## Testing

The Doors page has been tested for the following:

1. **Rendering**: Verified that the page renders correctly with all components
2. **Navigation**: Tested navigation to and from the page
3. **Responsive Design**: Checked that the page displays correctly on different screen sizes
4. **Logging**: Confirmed that page rendering is properly logged

## Next Steps

1. Continue the App Router migration for other pages
2. Update the documentation to reflect the changes
3. Implement the remaining door subpages (if any) in the App Router structure
4. Eventually remove the Pages Router implementation once all pages are migrated
