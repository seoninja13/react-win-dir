# Daily Log: May 28, 2025 - App Router Fixes

## Summary

Today's focus was on fixing the non-working pages by resolving routing conflicts and removing simplified debug versions. We also standardized the directory structure and migrated additional high-priority pages to the App Router.

## Tasks Completed

### 1. Fixed Non-Working Pages

#### 1.1. Bay-Bow Windows Page

- Temporarily renamed the Pages Router implementation from `Relume-root/pages/bay-bow.js` to `Relume-root/pages/bay-bow.js.bak`
- Tested the page at `/windows/bay-bow` to ensure the App Router implementation is being used
- Verified that all components render correctly
- Checked for any console errors

**Result**: The page now works correctly using the App Router implementation.

#### 1.2. Hinged Patio Doors Page

- Temporarily renamed the Pages Router implementation from `Relume-root/pages/hinged-patio-doors.js` to `Relume-root/pages/hinged-patio-doors.js.bak`
- Tested the page at `/doors/hinged-patio-doors` to ensure the App Router implementation is being used
- Verified that all components render correctly
- Checked for any console errors

**Result**: The page now works correctly using the App Router implementation.

#### 1.3. Vinyl Siding Series Pages

- Temporarily renamed all vinyl siding series Pages Router implementations:
  - `Relume-root/pages/1000-series.js` → `Relume-root/pages/1000-series.js.bak`
  - `Relume-root/pages/1500-series.js` → `Relume-root/pages/1500-series.js.bak`
  - `Relume-root/pages/2000-series.js` → `Relume-root/pages/2000-series.js.bak`
  - `Relume-root/pages/3000-series.js` → `Relume-root/pages/3000-series.js.bak`
  - `Relume-root/pages/4000-series.js` → `Relume-root/pages/4000-series.js.bak`
  - `Relume-root/pages/5000-series.js` → `Relume-root/pages/5000-series.js.bak`
- Tested each page at `/vinyl-siding/[series]` to ensure the App Router implementations are being used
- Verified that all components render correctly
- Checked for any console errors

**Result**: All vinyl siding series pages now work correctly using the App Router implementations.

#### 1.4. Garage Doors Page

- Renamed the simplified debug version from `src/app/garage-doors/page.tsx` to `src/app/garage-doors/page.tsx.bak`
- Tested the page at `/doors/garage` to ensure the actual implementation is being used
- Verified that all components render correctly
- Checked for any console errors

**Result**: The page now works correctly using the actual App Router implementation.

### 2. Standardized Directory Structure

#### 2.1. Identified App Router Pages Outside Relume-root

- Used the following command to list all App Router pages outside Relume-root:
  ```bash
  find src/app -name "page.tsx" | grep -v "Relume-root"
  ```
- Documented these pages for migration

#### 2.2. Moved App Router Pages to Relume-root/src/app/

- For each identified page:
  - Created the corresponding directory in `Relume-root/src/app/` if it didn't exist
  - Copied the page files from `src/app/` to `Relume-root/src/app/`
  - Updated import paths to reflect the correct directory structure
  - Tested each page to ensure it works correctly

**Result**: All App Router pages are now in the correct directory structure.

### 3. Migrated High-Priority Pages

#### 3.1. Entry Doors Page

- Created an App Router implementation at `Relume-root/src/app/doors/entry/page.tsx`
- Imported the existing Entry Doors page component
- Added logging functionality
- Tested the page

**Result**: The Entry Doors page now works correctly using the App Router implementation.

#### 3.2. Patio Doors Page

- Created an App Router implementation at `Relume-root/src/app/doors/patio/page.tsx`
- Imported the existing Patio Doors page component
- Added logging functionality
- Tested the page

**Result**: The Patio Doors page now works correctly using the App Router implementation.

## Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: Import Path Errors

**Issue Description**: Some pages had incorrect import paths, especially when referencing components across different directories.

**Root Cause**: The project has a mix of directory structures, with some components in the root directory and others in subdirectories.

**Solution**:
1. Updated import paths to use relative paths from the current file
2. Used the `@/` alias for imports from the `src` directory
3. Tested each page to ensure the imports work correctly

### Issue 2: Component Rendering Issues

**Issue Description**: Some components were not rendering correctly after moving to the App Router.

**Root Cause**: The components were using client-side functionality without the `'use client'` directive.

**Solution**:
1. Added the `'use client'` directive to components that use client-side functionality
2. Wrapped server components in client components where necessary
3. Tested each component to ensure it renders correctly

## Next Steps

1. **Continue App Router Migration**:
   - Migrate remaining Windows Pages (Sliding, Custom, Energy Efficient)
   - Migrate Informational Pages (About, Contact, FAQs)
   - Remove Pages Router implementations once all pages are migrated
   - Test all pages to ensure they work correctly
   - Document all changes and update tracking documentation

2. **Update Documentation**:
   - Update the App Router Migration Tracking document with the current status
   - Update the Webpage Progress Tracker with the current status
   - Create a new daily log for tomorrow's work

## Conclusion

Today's work has successfully fixed the non-working pages and continued the App Router migration. We have made significant progress in standardizing the directory structure and migrating high-priority pages. The project is now in a much better state, with all core pages working correctly using the App Router.
