## Overview

Today's focus was on implementing the Google Generative AI integration for image generation. This integration replaces the previous Unsplash integration and provides more control over the generated images, ensuring they match the specific products being displayed.

## Tasks Completed

### Database Setup

- Created database schema and tables in Supabase
- Implemented sample data for testing
- Verified database connectivity and queries

### Google Generative AI Integration

- Researched Google Generative AI SDK and Vertex AI Imagen API
- Created image generation utilities using the Google Generative AI SDK
- Implemented React hooks for image generation
- Created an example component demonstrating image generation capabilities
- Updated environment variable templates to include Google Cloud configuration
- Documented the integration process

### Vertex AI Integration

- Set up Vertex AI environment variables (GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=mold-removal-lead-gen, GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION=us-west1, GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI=true)
- Created Vertex AI client utilities for initializing and using the Vertex AI client
- Updated image generation utilities to use the Vertex AI client
- Created a test page at /vertex-ai-test for testing the integration
- Created a test script for direct testing of the Vertex AI client
- Implemented specialized React hooks for Vertex AI integration

### Google Cloud CLI Setup

- Installed Google Cloud CLI
- Initialized the CLI and authenticated with Google Cloud
- Set up application default credentials
- Verified the installation

### Documentation

- Created comprehensive documentation for the Google Generative AI integration
- Added a step-by-step guide for setting up and using the integration
- Updated the integrations index to include the new integration
- Updated the guides index to include the new guide
- Created this daily log entry

## Issues Encountered

### Issue 1: API Key Configuration

**Problem**: Initially, there was confusion about where to store the API key and how to access it in the code.

**Solution**: Decided to store the API key in the `.env.local` file and access it using `process.env.GOOGLE_CLOUD_API_KEY`. This follows the same pattern used for other API keys in the project.

### Issue 2: SDK Compatibility

**Problem**: The Google Generative AI SDK had some compatibility issues with the project's TypeScript configuration.

**Solution**: Updated the TypeScript configuration to include the necessary types and adjusted the SDK usage to match the project's TypeScript standards.

### Issue 3: Image Format

**Problem**: The generated images were returned as base64 strings, which needed to be converted to URLs for display.

**Solution**: Implemented a utility function to convert base64 strings to data URLs with the appropriate MIME type.

### Issue 4: Vertex AI Configuration

**Problem**: Configuring Vertex AI required specific environment variables and authentication setup.

**Solution**: Created a dedicated Vertex AI client utility that handles the initialization and authentication based on environment variables. This allows for a seamless switch between the direct Gemini API and Vertex AI.

## Next Steps

1. **Integrate with Product Pages**: Implement the image generation in the product pages to display generated images for products.
2. **Optimize Image Generation**: Fine-tune the prompts and parameters to generate better images for specific product categories.
3. **Implement Image Caching**: Store generated images in Supabase Storage to avoid regenerating them.
4. **Add Image Moderation**: Implement image moderation to ensure generated images are appropriate.
5. **Create Admin Interface**: Develop an admin interface for managing generated images.

## Notes

- The Google Generative AI SDK provides a more flexible and powerful way to generate images compared to the previous Unsplash integration.
- The Gemini model is faster but produces less detailed images, while the Imagen model produces higher quality images but is slower.
- We should consider the cost implications of generating images and implement appropriate caching and rate limiting.
- The integration is currently set up for development, but we'll need to adjust it for production use.
