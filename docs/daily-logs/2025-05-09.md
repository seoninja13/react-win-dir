## Issues Encountered

1. **Development Server Issues**
   - The development server was not starting properly

## Notes

- The Unsplash API integration is working well, but we need to be careful about the rate limits
- We should consider implementing caching for Unsplash images to reduce API calls
- The documentation structure is comprehensive, but we need to keep it updated as the project evolves
- The core pages are implemented, but we need to add more detailed content and improve the design
- Netlify Dev is a powerful tool for local development, but we need to complete the initialization process

- Core Page Implementation: 4 hours
- Unsplash API Integration: 3 hours
- Component Updates: 2 hours
