# Daily Log: May 21, 2025 - Website Pages Organization

## Summary

Today's focus was on organizing the page-specific folders in the Relume-root directory by creating a 'Website Pages' folder to centralize all page components. This improves the organization and management of the project structure while maintaining compatibility with existing import paths.

## Tasks Completed

### 1. Created Website Pages Directory

- Created a 'Website Pages' directory in the Relume-root directory to centralize all page-specific components
- Used junction points (symbolic links) to link the original page-specific folders to the Website Pages directory
- This approach maintains compatibility with existing import paths while improving organization

### 2. Created Junction Points for All Page Folders

Created junction points for all page-specific folders in the Relume-root directory:

```powershell
# Example command used to create junction points
New-Item -ItemType Junction -Path "Website Pages\hinged-patio-doors" -Target "hinged-patio-doors"
```

The following folders were organized in the Website Pages directory:

1. 1000-series
2. 1500-series
3. 2000-series
4. 3000-series
5. 4000-series
6. 5000-series
7. about
8. awning
9. bay-bow
10. blog
11. blog-post
12. casement
13. contact
14. custom
15. doors
16. double-hung
17. energy-efficient
18. entry
19. faqs
20. financing
21. free-estimate-request
22. gallery
23. garage
24. garden
25. giving-back
26. hinged-patio-doors
27. home
28. installation
29. patio
30. picture-window
31. press
32. recognition
33. referral-program
34. reviews
35. roofing
36. satisfaction-survey
37. service-areas
38. shutters
39. sliding
40. styles
41. vinyl-siding
42. virtual-repair-center
43. warranty
44. warranty-new
45. why-window-world
46. windows
47. window-style-finder
48. wood-windows

### 3. Updated Documentation

- Updated the project-structure-current-state.md file to reflect the new organization
- Created a new documentation file (website-pages-organization.md) to document the Website Pages organization
- Updated the architecture index to include the new documentation file

## Benefits of the New Organization

1. **Improved Organization**: All page-specific components are now centralized in one location
2. **Easier Navigation**: Developers can quickly find all website pages in one folder
3. **Cleaner Root Directory**: The Relume-root directory is less cluttered
4. **Maintained Compatibility**: No changes to import paths were required

## Technical Implementation Details

The Website Pages directory is implemented using junction points (symbolic links) to the original page-specific folders in the Relume-root directory. This approach has several advantages:

1. **No Import Path Changes**: The original import paths in the App Router pages continue to work without modification
2. **Dual Access**: The page-specific components can be accessed from both the original location and the Website Pages directory
3. **Synchronized Changes**: Any changes made to the files in either location are automatically reflected in both places
4. **No Duplication**: The files are not duplicated, saving disk space and avoiding synchronization issues

## Next Steps

1. **Update Development Workflow**: Update the development workflow to use the Website Pages directory for accessing page-specific components
2. **New Pages**: For new pages, create the page-specific folder in the Relume-root directory and then create a junction point to it in the Website Pages directory
3. **Documentation**: Continue to update documentation to reflect the new organization
