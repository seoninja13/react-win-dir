## Tasks Completed

### Home Page Implementation with Relume Components

1. **Verified Relume UI Installation and Configuration**
   - Confirmed that Relume UI packages are installed in package.json
   - Verified Tailwind CSS configuration for Relume UI in tailwind.config.ts
   - Checked Next.js configuration for image domains in next.config.js

2. **Created Directory Structure for Relume Components**
   - Created the following directories:
     - Relume-root/pages/home/
     - Relume-root/components/header/
     - Relume-root/components/layout/
     - Relume-root/components/gallery/
     - Relume-root/components/testimonial/
     - Relume-root/components/cta/

3. **Copied Home Page Components from @Relume-do-not-edit**
   - Copied the following components:
     - Header47.jsx → Relume-root/components/header/
     - Header15.jsx → Relume-root/components/header/
     - Layout6.jsx → Relume-root/components/layout/
     - Layout250.jsx → Relume-root/components/layout/
     - Layout4.jsx → Relume-root/components/layout/
     - Testimonial14.jsx → Relume-root/components/testimonial/
     - Layout251.jsx → Relume-root/components/layout/
     - Layout4_1.jsx → Relume-root/components/layout/
     - Gallery4.jsx → Relume-root/components/gallery/
     - Cta1.jsx → Relume-root/components/cta/

4. **Updated Home Page Index Component**
   - Updated import paths in Relume-root/pages/home/index.jsx to point to the new component locations
   - Added 'use client' directive to all components

5. **Updated Next.js Home Page**
   - Modified src/app/page.tsx to use the Relume HomePage component
   - Removed the previous implementation and replaced it with the Relume component

## Next Steps

1. **Test the Home Page Implementation**
   - Run the development server to ensure all components render correctly
   - Test responsive behavior at different screen sizes
   - Verify all interactive elements work as expected

2. **Implement Other Pages**
   - After successful testing of the Home page, proceed with Windows page implementation
   - Follow the same process for other pages (Doors, Vinyl Siding, Roofing, etc.)

## Notes

- All components were copied from the @Relume-do-not-edit folder without modifying the original files
- Added proper documentation to each component with source information
- Updated import paths to reflect the new directory structure
- Added 'use client' directive to all client components

## Issues and Challenges

### 1. Tailwind CSS PostCSS Configuration Issue

**Problem**: Encountered an error when running the development server:
```
Error: It looks like you're trying to use `tailwindcss` directly as a PostCSS plugin. The PostCSS plugin has moved to a separate package, so to continue using Tailwind CSS with PostCSS you'll need to install `@tailwindcss/postcss` and update your PostCSS configuration.
```

**Solution**:
1. Installed the `@tailwindcss/postcss` package:
   ```bash
   npm install @tailwindcss/postcss --save-dev
   ```

2. Updated the PostCSS configuration in postcss.config.js:
   ```javascript
   module.exports = {
     plugins: {
       'postcss-import': {},
       '@tailwindcss/postcss': {}, // Changed from tailwindcss to @tailwindcss/postcss
       autoprefixer: {},
     },
   };
   ```

3. Verified that the development server runs correctly after the changes

### 2. Project Structure Restructuring

**Problem**: The project had a mixed structure with Next.js App Router in `src/app/` and Relume components in `Relume-root/`, causing confusion and complex import paths.

**Solution**:
1. Created the correct directory structure in Relume-root:
   ```
   Relume-root/
   └── src/
       └── app/
           ├── home/
           ├── windows/
           ├── doors/
           └── ...
   ```

2. Created page files in the correct locations:
   - Created `page.tsx` in Relume-root/src/app for the root route
   - Created `page.tsx` in Relume-root/src/app/home for the /home route
   - Created placeholder `page.tsx` files for windows and doors routes
   - Created `layout.tsx` in Relume-root/src/app

3. Copied CSS files:
   - Copied globals.css and styles.css to Relume-root/src/app

4. Updated import paths to reflect the new structure

### 3. Relume Component Integration Pattern

**Problem**: The components copied from @Relume-do-not-edit were not following the Relume Section component pattern, which requires proper TypeScript typing and props handling.

**Solution**:
1. Updated the Header47.jsx component to follow the Section component pattern:
   - Added proper TypeScript types for props
   - Added defaultProps
   - Implemented props destructuring with defaults
   - Updated the component to use props for content

2. Updated the Header15.jsx component to follow the Section component pattern:
   - Added proper TypeScript types for props including ButtonProps and ImageProps
   - Added defaultProps
   - Implemented props destructuring with defaults
   - Updated the component to use props for content

3. Updated the home page to use the components with explicit props:
   ```jsx
   <Header47
     tagline="Quality"
     heading="Windows & Doors"
     description="Transform your home with our premium replacement windows and doors. Experience energy efficiency and style, all backed by a lifetime warranty."
     buttons={[
       { title: "Estimate", variant: "primary" },
       { title: "Call", variant: "secondary" },
     ]}
   />
   ```
