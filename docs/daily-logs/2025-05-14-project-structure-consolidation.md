# Project Structure Consolidation - 2025-05-14

## Overview

Today I began implementing the project structure consolidation plan to migrate all App Router pages from the obsolete `/src/app/` directory to the correct `Relume-root/src/app/` directory. This is a critical step in standardizing our project structure and simplifying our development workflow.

## Tasks Completed

### 1. Documentation Setup

- Created comprehensive documentation for the project structure consolidation:
  - `docs/processes/project-structure-consolidation-plan.md` - High-level plan
  - `docs/processes/project-structure-consolidation-implementation.md` - Detailed implementation guide
  - `docs/processes/page-route-mapping.md` - Mapping document for tracking migration progress

- Updated main documentation references:
  - Updated `README.md` to include references to the new documentation
  - Updated `docs/index.md` to include references to the new documentation
  - Created `docs/processes/index.md` to reference all process documentation

### 2. Layout File Consolidation

- Verified and updated the layout file in `Relume-root/src/app/layout.tsx`:
  - Added proper imports for the Inter font
  - Ensured correct metadata
  - Added proper className for the Inter font

- Verified CSS files in the correct location:
  - `Relume-root/src/app/globals.css` - Contains Tailwind directives
  - `Relume-root/src/app/styles.css` - Contains custom styles

### 3. Page Migration

Migrated the following pages from `/src/app/` to `Relume-root/src/app/`:

#### Root Pages:
- Home page (`page.tsx`)
- Layout file (`layout.tsx`)

#### Top-Level Pages:
- Windows page (`windows/page.tsx`)
- Doors page (`doors/page.tsx`)
- About page (`about/page.tsx`)
- Contact page (`contact/page.tsx`)
- Gallery page (`gallery/page.tsx`)
- FAQs page (`faqs/page.tsx`)
- Financing page (`financing/page.tsx`)
- Garden page (`garden/page.tsx`)
- Roofing page (`roofing/page.tsx`)
- Warranty page (`warranty/page.tsx`)

#### Nested Pages:
- Windows/Awning page (`windows/awning/page.tsx`)
- Windows/Casement page (`windows/casement/page.tsx`)
- Windows/Custom page (`windows/custom/page.tsx`)
- Windows/Shutters page (`windows/shutters/page.tsx`)
- Windows/Picture Window page (`windows/picture-window/page.tsx`)
- Windows/Energy Efficient page (`windows/energy-efficient/page.tsx`)
- Windows/Bay-Bow page (`windows/bay-bow/page.tsx`)
- Windows/Garden page (`windows/garden/page.tsx`)
- Windows/Sliding page (`windows/sliding/page.tsx`)
- Doors/Entry page (`doors/entry/page.tsx`)
- Doors/Patio page (`doors/patio/page.tsx`)
- About/Recognition page (`about/recognition/page.tsx`)
- Window Style Finder page (`window-style-finder/page.tsx`)

### 4. Migration Progress

- Total Pages to Migrate: 25
- Pages Completed: 25
- Pages Remaining: 0
- Progress: 100%

## Challenges Encountered

1. **Directory Creation Issues**: Encountered some issues with creating directories using the `mkdir` command. Worked around this by directly creating the files with the `save-file` tool.

2. **Git Branch Management**: Had some difficulties with git branch management, but was able to continue with the implementation on the current branch.

## Next Steps

1. Test all migrated pages to ensure they work correctly:
   - Start the development server and verify each page loads properly
   - Check for any console errors
   - Verify navigation between pages works as expected

2. Update import paths to be relative to `Relume-root`:
   - For top-level pages, change from `../../../[component-dir]/index.jsx` to `../../[component-dir]/index.jsx`
   - For nested pages, change from `../../../../[component-dir]/index.jsx` to `../../../[component-dir]/index.jsx`

3. Clean up the obsolete `/src/app/` directory:
   - Verify no imports are referencing this directory
   - Remove the directory once all pages have been successfully migrated and tested

4. Update documentation to reflect the new structure:
   - Update README.md
   - Update architecture documentation
   - Update any references to the old structure

## Conclusion

Successfully completed the migration of all 25 pages from the obsolete `/src/app/` directory to the correct `Relume-root/src/app/` directory. The migration process went smoothly, with only minor issues related to directory creation and git branch management. The next steps involve testing all migrated pages, updating import paths, cleaning up the obsolete directory, and updating documentation to reflect the new structure.
