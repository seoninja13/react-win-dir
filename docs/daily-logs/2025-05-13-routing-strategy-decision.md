# Daily Log: Routing Strategy Decision

**Topic**: Standardizing on Next.js App Router

## Overview

Today, we made the important decision to standardize our routing approach by exclusively using the Next.js App Router for all current and future development. This decision addresses the inconsistency we've been experiencing with having some pages in the Pages Router (`pages` directory) and others in the App Router (`src/app` directory).

## Background

Our project initially started with a mixed routing approach:

1. **Pages Router**: Many pages were implemented using the older Pages Router approach, with files in the `pages` directory. Examples include:
   - `/5000-series` (accessed via `pages/5000-series.js`)
   - `/windows` (accessed via `pages/windows.js`)
   - And many other product and informational pages

2. **App Router**: Some newer pages were implemented using the App Router approach, with files in the `src/app` directory. Examples include:
   - `/vinyl-siding/2000-series` (accessed via `src/app/vinyl-siding/2000-series/page.tsx`)
   - Other vinyl siding series pages

This inconsistency led to confusion in development, inconsistent URL structures, and maintenance challenges.

## Decision Details

After careful consideration and analysis of the current project state, we've decided to:

1. **Standardize on App Router**: Use the Next.js App Router exclusively for all new page implementations
2. **Migrate Existing Pages**: Gradually migrate all existing Pages Router pages to the App Router structure
3. **Document the Approach**: Create comprehensive documentation on our routing strategy
4. **Update Related Documentation**: Ensure all project documentation reflects this decision

## Rationale

The decision to standardize on the App Router was based on several factors:

1. **Future-Proofing**: The App Router is the future of Next.js routing, with the Pages Router being maintained but not receiving new features
2. **Enhanced Features**: The App Router provides advanced features such as:
   - Server Components
   - Nested Layouts
   - Route Groups
   - Loading UI
   - Error Handling
   - Streaming
3. **Consistency**: Using a single routing system simplifies development, documentation, and maintenance
4. **Performance**: The App Router offers improved performance through React Server Components and other optimizations
5. **URL Structure Consistency**: The App Router's directory-based routing naturally enforces a more consistent URL structure

## Implementation Plan

1. **Documentation Updates**:
   - Created a new routing strategy document (`docs/architecture/routing-strategy.md`)
   - Updated the architecture documentation to reflect the decision
   - Updated this daily log to document the decision process

2. **Migration Approach**:
   - Identify all pages currently using the Pages Router
   - Prioritize pages based on importance and complexity
   - Create new pages in the App Router structure
   - Test thoroughly to ensure the new pages function identically to the old ones
   - Update documentation to reflect the changes
   - Remove the old Pages Router pages once migration is complete and verified

3. **URL Structure Standardization**:
   - Product category pages: `/[category]` (e.g., `/windows`, `/doors`, `/vinyl-siding`)
   - Product detail pages: `/[category]/[product]` (e.g., `/windows/double-hung`, `/doors/entry`)
   - Series pages: `/vinyl-siding/[series]` (e.g., `/vinyl-siding/2000-series`)
   - Informational pages: `/[page-name]` (e.g., `/about-us`, `/warranty`, `/financing`)

## Immediate Next Steps

1. Begin migration with the 5000-series page, moving it from `/5000-series` to `/vinyl-siding/5000-series`
2. Update all internal links to reflect the new URL structure
3. Test thoroughly to ensure no broken links or functionality issues
4. Document the migration process for future reference

## Challenges and Considerations

1. **URL Changes**: Moving pages may affect SEO and existing links. We'll need to implement proper redirects.
2. **Testing Requirements**: Each migrated page will need thorough testing across devices and browsers.
3. **Documentation Updates**: All documentation referencing page URLs will need to be updated.
4. **Component Compatibility**: Some components may need adjustments to work properly with Server Components.

## Conclusion

This decision represents an important step toward a more consistent, maintainable, and future-proof codebase. While the migration process will require careful planning and execution, the long-term benefits of standardizing on the App Router will significantly improve our development workflow and application architecture.
