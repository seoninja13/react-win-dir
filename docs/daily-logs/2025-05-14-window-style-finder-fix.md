# Daily Log: Window Style Finder Page Fix

**Topic**: Fixing the Window Style Finder Page Build Error

## Overview

Today, I fixed a build error in the Window Style Finder page that was preventing the production build from completing successfully. The error was related to the `Card` component being imported from the `@relume_io/relume-ui` library but not actually being exported by that library.

## Issue Details

### Error Message

```
Error: Element type is invalid: expected a string (for built-in components) or a class/function (for composite components) but got: undefined.
```

### Warning Message

```
Attempted import error: 'Card' is not exported from '@relume_io/relume-ui' (imported as 'Card').
```

### Root Cause

The `Cta39.jsx` component in the `window-style-finder` directory was importing a `Card` component from `@relume_io/relume-ui`, but this component doesn't exist in the library. This is a known issue that has been encountered and fixed in multiple other components throughout the project.

### Affected Files

- `Relume-root/window-style-finder/components/Cta39.jsx`

## Solution

The solution was to replace the `Card` component with a regular `div` element with similar styling. This approach has been used consistently throughout the project for similar issues with the `Card` component.

### Code Changes

**Before:**

```jsx
"use client";

import { Button, Card } from "@relume_io/relume-ui";
import React from "react";

export function Cta39() {
  return (
    <section id="relume" className="px-[5%] py-16 md:py-24 lg:py-28">
      <div className="container">
        <Card className="grid auto-cols-fr grid-cols-1 lg:grid-cols-2">
          <div className="flex flex-col justify-center p-8 md:p-12">
            {/* Content */}
          </div>
          <div className="flex items-center justify-center">
            {/* Image */}
          </div>
        </Card>
      </div>
    </section>
  );
}
```

**After:**

```jsx
"use client";

import { Button } from "@relume_io/relume-ui";
import React from "react";

export function Cta39() {
  return (
    <section id="relume" className="px-[5%] py-16 md:py-24 lg:py-28">
      <div className="container">
        <div className="grid auto-cols-fr grid-cols-1 lg:grid-cols-2 border rounded-lg shadow-md">
          <div className="flex flex-col justify-center p-8 md:p-12">
            {/* Content */}
          </div>
          <div className="flex items-center justify-center">
            {/* Image */}
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </section>
  );
}
```

### Key Changes

1. Removed the `Card` import from `@relume_io/relume-ui`
2. Replaced the `<Card>` element with a `<div>` element
3. Added Tailwind CSS classes to the `<div>` to maintain the same visual appearance:
   - `border`: Adds a border
   - `rounded-lg`: Adds rounded corners
   - `shadow-md`: Adds a medium shadow

## Verification

After making the changes, I ran the production build again and verified that it completed successfully. The Window Style Finder page is now included in the build output:

```
├ ○ /window-style-finder                   4.63 kB280 kB
```

## Lessons Learned

1. The `Card` component is not actually exported by the `@relume_io/relume-ui` library, despite being imported in various components throughout the project.
2. A consistent approach to fixing this issue is to replace the `Card` component with a `div` element with similar styling using Tailwind CSS classes.
3. This pattern has been used successfully in multiple components across the project.

## Related Issues

This issue is similar to other Card component issues that have been encountered and fixed in other parts of the project:

- Warranty page components
- Vinyl Siding series pages
- Financing page components
- Wood Windows page components

## Next Steps

1. Continue with Phase 6 (Testing and Verification) of the App Router Standardization Plan
2. Test the Window Style Finder page in both development and production modes
3. Verify that all components render correctly
4. Test navigation between pages
