# Daily Log: May 10, 2025 - Home Page Integration

## Summary

Today's focus was on creating a comprehensive Home Page Integration Plan for the Windows Doors CA website using Relume UI components. This plan documents the exact process we followed to implement the Home page and serves as a template for implementing other pages in the project.

## Tasks Completed

### 1. Home Page Implementation Analysis

- Analyzed the structure of the Home page in the Relume-DO-NOT-EDIT folder
- Identified all components used in the Home page
- Documented the component hierarchy and dependencies
- Verified that all components were correctly copied to the Relume-root directory

### 2. Relume UI Component Testing

- Tested the Relume UI components in the Home page
- Verified that all components were rendering correctly
- Identified and fixed issues with component imports
- Ensured all components were using the correct styling

### 3. Home Page Integration Plan Creation

- Created a comprehensive Home Page Integration Plan document
- Documented the step-by-step process for implementing the Home page
- Included detailed instructions for setting up the project, configuring Tailwind CSS, and implementing components
- Added troubleshooting guidance for common issues

### 4. Documentation Updates

- Updated the documentation map to include the Home Page Integration Plan
- Updated the project tasks document to reflect the completion of the Home Page Integration Plan
- Updated the priority list to mark the Home Page Integration Plan as completed
- Created this daily log entry to document the process

## Home Page Integration Plan Details

The Home Page Integration Plan includes the following sections:

1. **Introduction**: Overview of the integration process and required setup
2. **Prerequisites**: List of requirements before beginning the integration
3. **Step-by-Step Integration Process**: Detailed instructions for:
   - Project setup and configuration
   - Directory structure creation
   - Component implementation
   - Component customization
4. **Component Structure**: Description of each component used in the Home page
5. **Testing and Validation**: Procedures for verifying the implementation
6. **Troubleshooting**: Solutions to common issues encountered during integration
7. **Next Steps**: Guidelines for implementing additional pages

## Issues Encountered

### 1. ESLint Configuration Error

- **Issue**: The build process was failing with an ESLint error: "Failed to load config 'next/core-web-vitals'"
- **Solution**: Created a `.eslintrc.json` file in the Relume-root directory with the correct configuration
- **Implementation**: Added the same ESLint configuration as the root-level file

### 2. RelumeProvider Import Error

- **Issue**: The `_app.js` file was trying to import `RelumeProvider` from '@relume_io/relume-ui', but that export doesn't exist
- **Solution**: Removed the RelumeProvider wrapper from `_app.js`
- **Implementation**: Simplified the `_app.js` file to just render the component without any wrapper

### 3. Build Process Issues

- **Issue**: The build process was failing with various errors
- **Solution**: Fixed the build process by resolving ESLint and import issues
- **Implementation**: Successfully built the project after fixing the issues

## Next Steps

1. **Implement Additional Pages**:
   - Use the Home Page Integration Plan as a template for implementing other pages
   - Follow the same process for Windows, Doors, About, and Contact pages
   - Ensure consistency across all pages

2. **Component Documentation**:
   - Create detailed documentation for each component used in the Home page
   - Document component props, styling, and usage patterns
   - Create a component library documentation page

3. **Testing and Validation**:
   - Test all components on different screen sizes
   - Verify responsive behavior
   - Ensure all interactive elements work correctly

## Time Tracking

- Home Page Analysis: 1 hour
- Relume UI Component Testing: 1.5 hours
- Home Page Integration Plan Creation: 2 hours
- Documentation Updates: 1 hour
- Total: 5.5 hours
