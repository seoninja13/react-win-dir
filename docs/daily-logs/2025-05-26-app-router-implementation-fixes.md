# Daily Log: May 26, 2025 - App Router Implementation Fixes

## Summary

Today's focus was on fixing the App Router implementations for several pages that were not working correctly. This is part of our complete migration from Pages Router to App Router architecture. The goal is to have all pages using only App Router routes, eventually removing all Pages Router implementations.

## Tasks Completed

### 1. Hinged Patio Doors Page App Router Implementation

- Created a new App Router route file at `Relume-root/src/app/doors/hinged-patio-doors/page.tsx`
- Imported the existing Hinged Patio Doors page component from `../../../../hinged-patio-doors/index.jsx`
- Added logging functionality to track page rendering
- Tested the page to ensure it works correctly

### 2. Garage Doors Page App Router Implementation

- Updated the existing App Router route file at `Relume-root/src/app/doors/garage/page.tsx`
- Added logging functionality to track page rendering
- Tested the page to ensure it works correctly

### 3. Verified Bay-Bow Windows Page App Router Implementation

- Verified the existing App Router implementation at `Relume-root/src/app/windows/bay-bow/page.tsx`
- Confirmed it correctly imports the Bay-Bow page component with proper logging
- Tested the page to ensure it works correctly

### 4. Verified Vinyl Siding Series Pages App Router Implementations

- Verified that all vinyl siding series pages (1000-series, 1500-series, 2000-series, 3000-series, 4000-series, 5000-series) have correct App Router implementations
- Confirmed they all have proper logging functionality
- Tested each page to ensure it works correctly

## Implementation Details

### Hinged Patio Doors Page

The Hinged Patio Doors page was implemented using the following approach:

1. Created an App Router route at `Relume-root/src/app/doors/hinged-patio-doors/page.tsx` with the following content:
   ```tsx
   'use client';

   import React, { useEffect } from 'react';
   import HingedPatioDoorsPage from '../../../../../hinged-patio-doors/index.jsx';
   import { logger } from '@/utils/logger';

   export default function HingedPatioDoors() {
     useEffect(() => {
       // Log that the hinged patio doors page has been rendered
       logger.info('Hinged Patio Doors page rendered', {
         component: 'HingedPatioDoorsPage',
         timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
       });
     }, []);

     return <HingedPatioDoorsPage />;
   }
   ```

2. Tested the page by accessing it directly via URL at `/doors/hinged-patio-doors`
3. Verified that the page renders correctly with all components

### Garage Doors Page

The Garage Doors page already had a proper implementation, but was missing logging functionality. It was updated with the following approach:

1. Updated the App Router route at `Relume-root/src/app/doors/garage/page.tsx` to add logging functionality:
   ```tsx
   useEffect(() => {
     // Log that the garage doors page has been rendered
     logger.info('Garage Doors page rendered', {
       component: 'GaragePage',
       timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
     });
   }, []);
   ```

2. Tested the page by accessing it directly via URL at `/doors/garage`
3. Verified that the page renders correctly with all components

## Issues and Solutions

No significant issues were encountered during the implementation of these fixes. The implementation was straightforward because:

1. We followed the established pattern for creating App Router routes
2. We used the existing components from the Relume-root directory
3. We added proper logging functionality to all pages

## Next Steps

1. Update the webpage progress tracker to reflect the current status of all pages
2. Update the App Router standardization plan to mark these pages as completed
3. Continue with implementing any remaining pages that need App Router implementations
4. Begin the process of removing Pages Router implementations once all pages have been migrated to App Router

## Conclusion

The implementation of these App Router fixes brings us closer to our goal of having all pages using only App Router routes. This will simplify our codebase and make it easier to maintain in the future.
