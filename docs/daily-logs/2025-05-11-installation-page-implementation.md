# Daily Log: May 11, 2025 - Installation Page Implementation

## Summary

Today's focus was on implementing and testing the Installation page for the Windows Doors CA website. The Installation page is a standard informational page (T4 template) that provides information about the installation process, benefits, and features.

## Tasks Completed

### 1. Installation Page Implementation

- Created a route for the Installation page
- Fixed issues with the Cta45 component by replacing the Card component with a custom div element
- Created a new Cta45New component to replace the problematic Cta45 component
- Updated the index.jsx file to use the new Cta45New component
- Tested the Installation page to ensure it renders correctly

### 2. Documentation Updates

- Updated the Webpage Progress Tracker to include the Installation page
- Updated the T4 template status to "Complete"
- Created this daily log entry to document the implementation process

## Implementation Details

### Route Creation

Created a route for the Installation page by adding a new file at `Relume-root/pages/installation.js` that exports the Installation component:

```javascript
export { default } from '../installation';
```

### Component Fixes

The Installation page had an issue with the Cta45 component, which was using the Card component from the Relume UI library. This component was causing errors similar to what we encountered with the Windows page. To fix this issue, we:

1. Created a new Cta45New.jsx component that replaces the Card component with a custom div element:

```jsx
"use client";

import { Button } from "@relume_io/relume-ui";
import React from "react";

export function Cta45New() {
  return (
    <section id="relume" className="px-[5%] py-16 md:py-24 lg:py-28">
      <div className="container">
        <div className="grid grid-cols-1 items-start justify-start gap-6 p-8 rounded-lg shadow-md bg-white md:grid-cols-[1fr_max-content] md:items-center md:justify-between md:gap-x-12 md:gap-y-8 lg:gap-x-20 lg:p-12">
          <div className="md:mr-12 lg:mr-0">
            <div className="w-full max-w-lg">
              <h3 className="mb-3 text-4xl leading-[1.2] font-bold md:mb-4 md:text-5xl lg:text-6xl">
                Get Started with Your Estimate
              </h3>
              <p className="md:text-md">
                Transform your home with expert installation today!
              </p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div className="flex w-full flex-wrap items-center justify-start gap-4 md:w-auto md:justify-end">
            <Button title="Learn More">Learn More</Button>
            <Button title="Sign Up" variant="secondary">
              Sign Up
            </Button>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </section>
  );
}
```

2. Updated the index.jsx file to use the new Cta45New component:

```jsx
import { Cta45New } from "./components/Cta45New";
```

```jsx
<Cta45New />
```

### Testing

After implementing the fixes, we tested the Installation page by:

1. Opening the page in the browser at http://localhost:3002/installation
2. Checking the console for any errors
3. Verifying that the page renders correctly with all components

## Issues Encountered

1. **Card Component Error**: The Card component from the Relume UI library was causing errors. This is a known issue that we've encountered before with the Windows page.

2. **Component Replacement**: We had to create a new component (Cta45New) to replace the problematic Cta45 component, as directly modifying the existing component was causing issues.

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Testing**: Continue testing the Installation page to ensure all components render correctly and all functionality works as expected.

2. **Implement Internal Links**: Implement and test all internal links on the Installation page.

3. **Rail Room Integration**: Complete the integration with Rail Room for the Installation page.

4. **Documentation**: Create detailed documentation for the Installation page, including component structure, content, and functionality.

## Time Tracking

- Installation Page Implementation: 2 hours
- Documentation Updates: 1 hour
- Total: 3 hours
