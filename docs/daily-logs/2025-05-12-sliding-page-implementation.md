**Task:** Implement the sliding windows page

## Overview

This document details the implementation of the sliding windows page for the Windows Doors CA website. The sliding windows page showcases sliding window products, their features, benefits, and design options.

## Implementation Details

The sliding windows page was implemented by creating a route file that points to the existing sliding page component. The implementation was straightforward as the sliding directory and components already existed in the Relume-root directory.

### Implementation Steps

1. Verified that the sliding page directory and components already existed in the Relume-root directory
2. Confirmed that the sliding directory contained the necessary components, including:
   - index.jsx file
   - Various component files in the components directory
3. Created a route file at `Relume-root/pages/sliding.js` with the following content:
   ```javascript
   export { default } from '../sliding';
   ```
4. Tested the page by opening it in the browser at http://localhost:3000/sliding
5. Confirmed that the page rendered correctly with all components

### Directory Structure

The sliding windows page follows the standard directory structure for product pages:

```
sliding/
├── components/
│   ├── Navbar10.jsx
│   ├── Header44.jsx
│   ├── Header9.jsx
│   ├── Layout10.jsx
│   ├── Layout16.jsx
│   ├── Layout22.jsx
│   ├── Layout4.jsx
│   ├── Layout237.jsx
│   ├── Layout245.jsx
│   ├── Layout253.jsx
│   ├── Gallery4.jsx
│   ├── Faq9.jsx
│   └── Footer4.jsx
└── index.jsx
```

## Issues and Solutions

No issues were encountered during the implementation of the sliding windows page. The implementation was straightforward because:

1. The sliding page directory and components already existed in the Relume-root directory
2. All components were properly implemented and did not require any modifications
3. The route file creation followed the same pattern as other successfully implemented pages

## Lessons Learned

1. **Check Existing Files**: Always check if the page directory and components already exist before creating new ones.
2. **Follow Established Patterns**: Follow the patterns established in existing, working pages for creating route files.
3. **Test Thoroughly**: Always test the page in the browser to ensure all components render correctly.

## Next Steps

1. Update the webpage progress tracker to include the sliding windows page
2. Create documentation for the sliding windows page
3. Continue with implementing the remaining pages from the Relume-DO-NOT-EDIT directory

## Conclusion

The sliding windows page has been successfully implemented and is working as expected. The implementation was straightforward, with no issues encountered.
