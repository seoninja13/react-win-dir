## Tasks Completed

### Project Structure Reorganization

1. **Identified Correct Project Structure**
   - Analyzed the current project structure
   - Determined the correct structure should be:
     ```
     react-win-dir/
     └── Relume-root/
         ├── src/
         │   └── app/
         │       ├── home/
         │       ├── windows/
         │       ├── doors/
         │       └── ...
         └── ...
     ```

2. **Deleted Incorrect Directory Structure**
   - Removed the src directory at the root level
   - Verified that the src directory was completely deleted

3. **Reorganized Project Structure**
   - Renamed the pages directory to pages-components to avoid conflicts with Next.js
   - Updated the import paths in the page files
   - Updated the package.json scripts to use Relume-root as the working directory
   - Moved the necessary configuration files to Relume-root
   - Updated the tailwind.config.ts file to use the correct content paths
   - Moved the dist directory from the project root to Relume-root
   - Moved the node_modules directory from the project root to Relume-root
   - Moved the public directory from the project root to Relume-root
   - Updated the next.config.js file to explicitly set the distDir

4. **Created Documentation**
   - Created working-directory.md to document the project structure
   - Updated daily logs with the changes made
   - Updated export-documentation.md with the new project structure
   - Updated README.md files with the new project structure

### Relume Integration

1. **Fixed Component Implementation**
   - Updated Header47.jsx and Header15.jsx to use JavaScript JSDoc syntax instead of TypeScript
   - Fixed import paths in the components
   - Removed TypeScript type annotations in the map functions

2. **Fixed Build Issues**
   - Fixed TypeScript error in the tailwind.config.ts file
   - Successfully built the project with npm run build
   - Tested the implementation with npm run dev

### SEO Strategy Document Updates

1. **Updated Domain References**
   - Changed all references from windowworldla.com to windowsdoorsca.com
   - Updated canonical URLs, Open Graph tags, Twitter Card tags, and structured data
   - Updated XML sitemap and robots.txt references

2. **Updated Business Name and Location**
   - Changed "Window World LA" to "Windows Doors CA"
   - Updated location references from "Los Angeles" to "California" and "Sacramento"

   - Updated primary keywords to focus on California instead of Los Angeles
   - Updated long-tail keywords to target California market
   - Updated content strategy to reflect the new geographic focus

## Issues and Challenges

### 1. Project Structure Confusion

**Problem**: The project had a mixed structure with files at the root level and in the Relume-root directory, causing confusion and complex import paths.

**Solution**:
1. Deleted the src directory at the root level
2. Made Relume-root the primary working directory
3. Updated the package.json scripts to run commands from the Relume-root directory
4. Created clear documentation about the working directory structure

### 2. Next.js Pages vs App Router Conflict

**Problem**: There was a conflict between the Next.js Pages Router and App Router due to the presence of both a pages directory and an app directory.

**Solution**:
1. Renamed the pages directory to pages-components to avoid conflicts
2. Updated import paths in the page files to point to the pages-components directory
3. Ensured that the App Router was used for routing

### 3. TypeScript Syntax Issues

**Problem**: The components were using TypeScript syntax, but the project was configured to use JavaScript.

**Solution**:
1. Converted TypeScript type annotations to JSDoc comments
2. Removed TypeScript type annotations in the map functions
3. Fixed TypeScript error in the tailwind.config.ts file

## Next Steps

1. **Implement Additional Pages**
   - Implement the Windows page with components from @Relume-do-not-edit
   - Implement the Doors page with components from @Relume-do-not-edit
   - Implement other pages (Vinyl Siding, Roofing, Contact, etc.)

2. **Enhance Documentation**
   - Create component documentation
   - Update the README.md file with the new project structure
   - Create a style guide for the project

3. **Implement Testing**
   - Set up testing infrastructure
   - Write tests for the components
   - Implement end-to-end testing

## Resources Used

- Relume UI documentation: https://react-docs.relume.io/
- Next.js documentation: https://nextjs.org/docs
- Project architecture documentation
- @Relume-do-not-edit folder as the source for components
