# Daily Log: Project Structure Consolidation Plan

**Topic**: Project Structure Consolidation Plan

## Overview

Today, I created a comprehensive plan to consolidate the project structure by removing duplicate directories and files outside the `Relume-root` directory. This plan is a Priority 1 (Critical) task that should be implemented immediately after the App Router standardization.

## Current State Analysis

During our work on the App Router standardization, we discovered that the project has a mixed structure with directories and files both at the root level and inside the `Relume-root` directory. This is causing confusion and maintenance challenges.

### Confirmed Duplicates to Remove

Based on our analysis, the following directories and files outside `Relume-root` are duplicates that can be safely removed:

1. **Series Directories**:
   - `1000-series`
   - `1500-series`
   - `4000-series`
   - `5000-series`

2. **Pages Directory**:
   - `pages` directory at the root level

3. **Src Directory**:
   - `src` directory at the root level

4. **Configuration Files**:
   - Any duplicate configuration files at the root level that are also in `Relume-root`

## Implementation Plan

The implementation plan consists of 5 phases:

1. **Phase 1: Identify Duplicates** (0.5 day)
   - Create a list of all directories and files at the root level that are duplicates of content in `Relume-root`

2. **Phase 2: Remove Duplicates** (0.5 day)
   - Remove series directories (`1000-series`, `1500-series`, `4000-series`, `5000-series`)
   - Remove `pages` directory
   - Remove `src` directory
   - Remove duplicate configuration files

3. **Phase 3: Configuration Updates** (0.5 day)
   - Update `package.json` scripts
   - Update any remaining root configuration files

4. **Phase 4: Testing and Verification** (0.5 day)
   - Test development server
   - Test production build

5. **Phase 5: Documentation** (0.5 day)
   - Update project documentation
   - Create daily log

## Timeline

The implementation is expected to take 2.5 days (May 15-17, 2025).

## Risks and Mitigation

1. **Build Errors**: Changes to the project structure could cause build errors.
   - **Mitigation**: Test the build process after removing duplicates and fix any issues immediately.

2. **Configuration Conflicts**: Removing configuration files could cause conflicts.
   - **Mitigation**: Carefully review configuration files before removal and ensure all necessary settings are preserved.

## Next Steps

1. Begin implementation on May 15, 2025
2. Follow the implementation plan as outlined
3. Document progress and any issues encountered
