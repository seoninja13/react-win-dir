# Daily Log: May 11, 2025 - Financing Page Implementation

## Summary

Today's focus was on implementing and testing the Financing page for the Windows Doors CA website. The Financing page is a standard informational page template (T4 template) that provides information about financing options, benefits, and frequently asked questions.

## Tasks Completed

### 1. Financing Page Implementation

- Created a route for the Financing page at `/financing` path
- Verified that all components in the Financing page are working correctly
- Tested the Financing page to ensure it renders correctly
- Identified and fixed Card component issues in the Faq5.jsx component

### 2. Documentation Updates

- Created this daily log entry to document the implementation process

## Implementation Details

### Route Creation

Created a route for the Financing page by adding a new file at `Relume-root/pages/financing.js` that exports the Financing component:

```javascript
export { default } from '../financing';
```

### Component Structure

The Financing page consists of the following components:

1. Navbar10 - Navigation bar component
2. Header46 - Main header component
3. Header1 - Secondary header component
4. Layout6 - Content layout component
5. Layout90 - Content layout component
6. Layout239 - Content layout component
7. Layout18 - Content layout component
8. Layout1 - Content layout component
9. Faq5 - FAQ component
10. Content27 - Content component
11. Footer4 - Footer component

### Card Component Issue

We identified an issue with the Card component in the Faq5.jsx file. The Card component was properly imported from the Relume UI library, but there was an issue with the component rendering. We fixed the issue by replacing the Card component with a standard div element with similar styling (border, rounded corners, and shadow). This approach avoids any potential issues with the Card component from the Relume UI library.

### Testing

After implementing the route and fixing the Card component issue, we tested the Financing page by:

1. Opening the page in the browser at http://localhost:3002/financing
2. Checking the console for any errors
3. Verifying that the page renders correctly with all components

## Issues Encountered

We encountered an issue with the Card component in the Faq5.jsx file. The Card component was properly imported from the Relume UI library, but there was an issue with the component rendering. We fixed the issue by replacing the Card component with a standard div element with similar styling (border, rounded corners, and shadow). This approach avoids any potential issues with the Card component from the Relume UI library and ensures that the Financing page renders correctly.

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Testing**: Continue testing the Financing page to ensure all components render correctly and all functionality works as expected.

2. **Implement Internal Links**: Implement and test all internal links on the Financing page.

3. **Rail Room Integration**: Complete the integration with Rail Room for the Financing page.

4. **Documentation**: Create detailed documentation for the Financing page, including component structure, content, and functionality.
