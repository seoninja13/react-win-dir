# Daily Log: May 31, 2025 - To-Do List Management Implementation

> **Breadcrumb Navigation**: [README.md](../../README.md) > [Documentation](../index.md) > [Daily Logs](./index.md) > 2025-05-31 To-Do List Management Implementation

## Summary

Today we implemented the To-Do List Management with AI Sync feature, which provides a seamless, project-aware task management system that integrates directly with the development workflow. This feature allows developers to quickly add, update, and complete tasks, while also enabling AI assistants to interact with the task list, creating a collaborative environment between developers and AI tools.

## Tasks Completed

### 1. Created Core Functionality

- Implemented the To-Do List Manager module for managing tasks
- Created the File System Integration for storing tasks in different formats (JSON, Markdown, YAML)
- Developed the Command Line Interface for interacting with tasks
- Implemented the AI Integration for enabling AI assistants to interact with tasks
- Created the Notification System for alerting users about task updates

### 2. Added Command-Line Interface

- Created a command-line interface for adding, listing, completing, and updating tasks
- Implemented commands for prioritizing and categorizing tasks
- Added configuration management commands
- Created AI interaction commands

### 3. Updated Package Configuration

- Added npm scripts for to-do list management commands
- Added required dependencies (uuid, js-yaml)
- Created configuration file for to-do list settings

### 4. Created Documentation

- Created comprehensive documentation in `Docs/features/todo-list-management.md`
- Added usage instructions, configuration details, and technical architecture
- Updated documentation with implementation status

### Key Features Implemented

1. **Project-Aware Task Management**: Tasks are stored in a structured format within the project
2. **Command Line Interface**: Quick commands for adding, updating, and completing tasks
3. **AI Integration**: AI assistants can read, add, and mark tasks as complete
4. **Task Prioritization**: Tasks can be prioritized and categorized
5. **Task Synchronization**: Tasks are synchronized across the project

### Configuration Options

The feature is highly configurable through the `.todo-config.json` file:

- **Storage Options**: Format (JSON, Markdown, YAML), path, backup settings
- **Task Options**: Default priority, available priorities, statuses, and categories
- **Notification Options**: Enable/disable notifications, startup notifications, reminder interval
- **AI Integration Options**: Enable/disable AI integration, allow add/complete/update, require confirmation

### npm Scripts Added

- `npm run todo:add <title>`: Add a new task
- `npm run todo:list`: List all tasks
- `npm run todo:complete <index>`: Complete a task
- `npm run todo:update <index> <title>`: Update a task
- `npm run todo:delete <index>`: Delete a task
- `npm run todo:prioritize <index> <priority>`: Set task priority
- `npm run todo:categorize <index> <category>`: Set task category
- `npm run todo:config`: View or update configuration
- `npm run todo:ai <message>`: Process an AI message

## Testing

The implementation was tested with the following scenarios:

1. **Task Management**: Tested adding, listing, completing, and updating tasks
2. **Storage Formats**: Verified storage in different formats (JSON, Markdown, YAML)
3. **AI Integration**: Tested AI interaction with the to-do list
4. **Configuration**: Verified configuration loading and saving

All tests passed successfully, and the feature is now ready for use.

## Next Steps

1. **User Training**: Provide training to team members on using the new feature
2. **Integration with Issue Trackers**: Explore integration with GitHub Issues, Linear, or Jira
3. **Web Interface**: Consider adding a web interface for managing tasks
4. **Team Collaboration**: Enable team collaboration on tasks
5. **Advanced AI Capabilities**: Enhance AI integration with more advanced capabilities
