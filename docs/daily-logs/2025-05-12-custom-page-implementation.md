# Custom Windows Page Implementation

**Date:** May 12, 2025  
**Author:** Augment Agent  
**Task:** Implement the custom windows page

## Overview

This document details the implementation of the custom windows page for the Windows Doors CA website. The custom windows page showcases custom window products, their features, benefits, and design options.

## Implementation Details

The custom windows page was implemented by creating a route file that points to the existing custom page component. The implementation required fixing issues with the Faq4 and Gallery13 components that were using Relume UI components that weren't properly configured.

### Implementation Steps

1. Verified that the custom page directory and components already existed in the Relume-root directory
2. Confirmed that the custom directory contained the necessary components, including:
   - index.jsx file
   - Various component files in the components directory
3. Created a route file at `Relume-root/pages/custom.js` with the following content:
   ```javascript
   export { default } from '../custom';
   ```
4. Tested the page by opening it in the browser at http://localhost:3000/custom
5. Encountered errors with the Faq4 and Gallery13 components that were using components from @relume_io/relume-ui
6. Fixed the Faq4 component by replacing the Accordion components with a custom implementation using React's useState hook
7. Fixed the Gallery13 component by replacing the Carousel components with a custom implementation using React's useState hook
8. Tested the page again and confirmed it was working correctly

### Directory Structure

The custom windows page follows the standard directory structure for product pages:

```
custom/
├── components/
│   ├── Navbar10.jsx
│   ├── Header49.jsx
│   ├── Header36.jsx
│   ├── Layout4.jsx
│   ├── Layout249.jsx
│   ├── Layout3.jsx
│   ├── Layout25.jsx
│   ├── Gallery13.jsx (modified)
│   ├── Layout254.jsx
│   ├── Testimonial5.jsx
│   ├── Faq4.jsx (modified)
│   └── Footer4.jsx
└── index.jsx
```

## Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: Relume UI Accordion Component Error in Faq4

**Error Message**: 
```
Server Error
Error: Element type is invalid: expected a string (for built-in components) or a class/function (for composite components) but got: undefined. You likely forgot to export your component from the file it's defined in, or you might have mixed up default and named imports.
```

**Root Cause**: The Faq4 component was importing Accordion, AccordionContent, AccordionItem, AccordionTrigger, Button, and Card components from @relume_io/relume-ui, but these components weren't properly configured or available in the project.

**Solution**: 
1. Created a custom implementation of the accordion functionality using React's useState hook
2. Replaced the Relume UI components with standard HTML/JSX elements styled with Tailwind CSS
3. Maintained the same visual appearance and functionality as the original component

**Modified Component Code**:
```jsx
"use client";

import React, { useState } from "react";
import { RxPlus } from "react-icons/rx";

export function Faq4() {
  const [openItems, setOpenItems] = useState({});

  const toggleItem = (itemId) => {
    setOpenItems((prev) => ({
      ...prev,
      [itemId]: !prev[itemId],
    }));
  };

  return (
    <section id="relume" className="px-[5%] py-16 md:py-24 lg:py-28">
      <div className="container max-w-lg">
        <div className="rb-12 mb-12 text-center md:mb-18 lg:mb-20">
          <h2 className="rb-5 mb-5 text-5xl font-bold md:mb-6 md:text-7xl lg:text-8xl">
            FAQs
          </h2>
          <p className="md:text-md">
            Find answers to your questions about custom windows and their
            benefits.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div className="grid items-start justify-stretch gap-4">
          {/* FAQ items with custom accordion implementation */}
        </div>
        <div className="mx-auto mt-12 max-w-md text-center md:mt-18 lg:mt-20">
          <h4 className="mb-3 text-2xl font-bold md:mb-4 md:text-3xl md:leading-[1.3] lg:text-4xl">
            Still have questions?
          </h4>
          <p className="md:text-md">Reach out to our team for assistance.</p>
          <div className="mt-6 md:mt-8">
            <button className="inline-flex h-12 items-center justify-center rounded-lg bg-gray-800 px-6 text-center font-medium text-white transition-colors hover:bg-gray-900 focus-visible:outline-none focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-ring focus-visible:ring-offset-2 disabled:pointer-events-none disabled:opacity-50">
              Contact
            </button>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </section>
  );
}
```

### Issue 2: Relume UI Carousel Component Error in Gallery13

**Error Message**: 
```
Server Error
Error: Element type is invalid: expected a string (for built-in components) or a class/function (for composite components) but got: undefined. You likely forgot to export your component from the file it's defined in, or you might have mixed up default and named imports.
```

**Root Cause**: The Gallery13 component was importing Carousel, CarouselContent, CarouselItem, CarouselNext, and CarouselPrevious components from @relume_io/relume-ui, but these components weren't properly configured or available in the project.

**Solution**: 
1. Created a custom implementation of the carousel functionality using React's useState hook
2. Replaced the Relume UI components with standard HTML/JSX elements styled with Tailwind CSS
3. Implemented next/previous buttons and dot indicators for navigation
4. Maintained the same visual appearance and functionality as the original component

**Modified Component Code**:
```jsx
"use client";

import React, { useState } from "react";

export function Gallery13() {
  const [currentSlide, setCurrentSlide] = useState(0);
  const totalSlides = 2;

  const nextSlide = () => {
    setCurrentSlide((prev) => (prev === totalSlides - 1 ? 0 : prev + 1));
  };

  const prevSlide = () => {
    setCurrentSlide((prev) => (prev === 0 ? totalSlides - 1 : prev - 1));
  };

  const goToSlide = (index) => {
    setCurrentSlide(index);
  };

  return (
    <section id="relume">
      <div className="px-[5%] py-16 md:py-24 lg:py-28">
        <div className="container text-center">
          <h2 className="rb-5 mb-5 text-5xl font-bold md:mb-6 md:text-7xl lg:text-8xl">
            Window Gallery
          </h2>
          <p className="md:text-md">
            Explore our stunning custom window installations in Sacramento.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div className="relative overflow-hidden">
        {/* Carousel implementation with custom navigation */}
      </div>
    </section>
  );
}
```

## Lessons Learned

1. **Relume UI Component Issues**: Components from @relume_io/relume-ui may not be properly configured or available in the project. When encountering errors with these components, create custom implementations using standard React patterns.

2. **Custom Accordion Implementation**: For accordion functionality, a simple implementation using React's useState hook can be used as a replacement for the Relume UI Accordion components.

3. **Custom Carousel Implementation**: For carousel functionality, a simple implementation using React's useState hook can be used as a replacement for the Relume UI Carousel components.

4. **Component Reuse**: Similar issues might occur with other components that use Relume UI components. The same approach can be used to fix those components.

## Next Steps

1. Update the webpage progress tracker to include the custom windows page
2. Create documentation for the custom windows page
3. Check other pages for similar issues with Relume UI components
4. Continue with implementing the remaining pages from the Relume-DO-NOT-EDIT directory

## Conclusion

The custom windows page has been successfully implemented and is working as expected. The issues with the Faq4 and Gallery13 components have been resolved by creating custom implementations of the accordion and carousel functionality. This approach can be used for other components that encounter similar issues with Relume UI components.
