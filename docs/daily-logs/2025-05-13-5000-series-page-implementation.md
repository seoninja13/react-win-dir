# 5000-Series Page Implementation

**Date:** May 13, 2025  
**Author:** Augment Agent  
**Task:** Implement the 5000-series page

## Overview

This document details the implementation of the 5000-series page for the Windows Doors CA website. The 5000-series page showcases the flagship vinyl siding product, its features, benefits, and design options.

## Implementation Details

The 5000-series page was implemented by creating a route file that points to the existing 5000-series page component. The implementation required fixing an issue with the Faq5.jsx component.

### Implementation Steps

1. Verified that the 5000-series page directory and components already existed in the Relume-root directory
2. Confirmed that the 5000-series directory contained the necessary components
3. Verified that the route file at `Relume-root/pages/5000-series.js` existed with the following content:
   ```javascript
   export { default } from '../5000-series';
   ```
4. Verified that the App Router route file at `src/app/vinyl-siding/5000-series/page.tsx` existed with the following content:
   ```typescript
   'use client';

   import React from 'react';
   import Series5000Page from '../../../../5000-series/index.jsx';

   export default function Series5000() {
     return <Series5000Page />;
   }
   ```
5. Identified an issue with the Faq5.jsx component and fixed it

### Directory Structure

The 5000-series page follows the standard directory structure for product pages:

```
5000-series/
├── components/
│   ├── Navbar10.jsx
│   ├── Header44.jsx
│   ├── Header15.jsx
│   ├── Layout16.jsx
│   ├── Layout6.jsx
│   ├── Layout10.jsx
│   ├── Gallery2.jsx
│   ├── Layout24.jsx
│   ├── Testimonial5.jsx
│   ├── Layout3.jsx
│   ├── Faq5.jsx
│   └── Footer4.jsx
└── index.jsx
```

## Issues and Solutions

### 1. Accordion Component Import Error

**Issue**: The Faq5.jsx component in the Relume-root/5000-series/components directory was not importing the Accordion, AccordionContent, AccordionItem, and AccordionTrigger components from @relume_io/relume-ui, which are required for the accordion functionality.

**Error Message**: The page would not load properly because the Faq5.jsx component was using a different structure than the other series' Faq5.jsx components.

**Solution**: Modified the Faq5.jsx component to import the necessary components and update the component structure to match the working components from other series:

```jsx
// Before
import { Button } from "@relume_io/relume-ui";
import React from "react";
import { RxPlus } from "react-icons/rx";

// After
import {
  Accordion,
  AccordionContent,
  AccordionItem,
  AccordionTrigger,
  Button,
} from "@relume_io/relume-ui";
import React from "react";
import { RxPlus } from "react-icons/rx";
```

Also updated the component structure to use the Accordion components:

```jsx
// Before
<div className="grid items-start justify-stretch gap-4">
  <div className="border rounded-md shadow-sm">
    <div className="border-none px-5 md:px-6">
      <div className="flex w-full items-center justify-between py-4 md:py-5 md:text-md">
        <span>What distinguishes the 5000 Series as your flagship vinyl siding?</span>
        <RxPlus className="size-7 shrink-0 text-text-primary md:size-8" />
      </div>
      <div className="md:pb-6">
        Content...
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

// After
<Accordion
  type="multiple"
  className="grid items-start justify-stretch gap-4"
>
  <div className="border rounded-md shadow-sm">
    <AccordionItem value="item-0" className="border-none px-5 md:px-6">
      <AccordionTrigger
        icon={
          <RxPlus className="size-7 shrink-0 text-text-primary transition-transform duration-300 md:size-8" />
        }
        className="md:py-5 md:text-md [&[data-state=open]>svg]:rotate-45"
      >
        What distinguishes the 5000 Series as your flagship vinyl siding?
      </AccordionTrigger>
      <AccordionContent className="md:pb-6">
        Content...
      </AccordionContent>
    </AccordionItem>
  </div>
</Accordion>
```

## Lessons Learned

1. **Component Consistency**: Ensure that components with the same name across different pages have consistent imports and structure.
2. **Check Existing Files**: Always check if the page directory and components already exist before creating new ones.
3. **Follow Established Patterns**: Follow the patterns established in existing, working pages for creating route files and components.
4. **Troubleshoot Methodically**: When encountering issues, compare the problematic component with working versions of the same component from other pages.

## Next Steps

1. Test the 5000-series page thoroughly to ensure all components render correctly
2. Update the webpage progress tracker to reflect the completion of the 5000-series page
3. Document any additional issues or improvements needed for the 5000-series page
