**Task:** Implement the shutters page

## Overview

This document details the implementation of the shutters page for the Windows Doors CA website. The shutters page showcases window shutter products, their features, benefits, and design options.

## Implementation Details

The shutters page was implemented by creating a route file that points to the existing shutters page component. The implementation was straightforward, with no issues encountered.

### Implementation Steps

1. Verified that the shutters page directory and components already existed in the Relume-root directory
2. Confirmed that the shutters directory contained the necessary components, including:
   - index.jsx file
   - Various component files in the components directory
3. Created a route file at `Relume-root/pages/shutters.js` with the following content:
   ```javascript
   export { default } from '../shutters';
   ```
4. Tested the page by opening it in the browser at http://localhost:3000/shutters
5. Verified that the page loaded correctly with no errors

### Directory Structure

The shutters page follows the standard directory structure for product pages:

```
shutters/
├── components/
│   ├── Faq2.jsx
│   ├── Footer4.jsx
│   ├── Gallery9.jsx
│   ├── Header30.jsx
│   ├── Header44.jsx
│   ├── Layout1.jsx
│   ├── Layout22.jsx
│   ├── Layout3.jsx
│   ├── Layout4.jsx
│   ├── Navbar10.jsx
│   └── Testimonial1.jsx
└── index.jsx
```

The `index.jsx` file imports all components and renders them in the correct order:

```jsx
import React from "react";
import { Navbar10 } from "./components/Navbar10";
import { Header44 } from "./components/Header44";
import { Header30 } from "./components/Header30";
import { Layout4 } from "./components/Layout4";
import { Layout22 } from "./components/Layout22";
import { Layout1 } from "./components/Layout1";
import { Gallery9 } from "./components/Gallery9";
import { Testimonial1 } from "./components/Testimonial1";
import { Layout3 } from "./components/Layout3";
import { Faq2 } from "./components/Faq2";
import { Footer4 } from "./components/Footer4";

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Navbar10 />
      <Header44 />
      <Header30 />
      <Layout4 />
      <Layout22 />
      <Layout1 />
      <Gallery9 />
      <Testimonial1 />
      <Layout3 />
      <Faq2 />
      <Footer4 />
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Issues and Solutions

No issues were encountered during the implementation of the shutters page. The page was already properly set up with all necessary components, and creating the route file was straightforward.

## Lessons Learned

1. **Check for Existing Files**: Always check if the necessary components and directories already exist before creating new ones.
2. **Verify Component Structure**: Confirm that all components are properly structured and imported in the index.jsx file.
3. **Test the Page**: Always test the page in the browser to ensure all components render correctly.

## Next Steps

1. Update the webpage progress tracker to include the shutters page
2. Create documentation for the shutters page
3. Continue with implementing the remaining pages from the Relume-DO-NOT-EDIT directory

## Conclusion

The shutters page has been successfully implemented and is working as expected. No issues were encountered during the implementation process, as the page was already properly set up with all necessary components, and creating the route file was straightforward.
