# Entry Page Implementation and 5000-Series Page Error Documentation

**Date:** May 12, 2025  
**Author:** Augment Agent  
**Task:** Implement the entry page and document errors encountered with the 5000-series page

## Overview

This document details the implementation of the entry page for the Windows Doors CA website and documents the errors encountered during the attempted implementation of a non-existent 5000-series page.

## Entry Page Implementation

The entry page was successfully implemented by creating a route file that points to the existing entry page component. The entry page showcases entry doors, their features, benefits, and design options.

### Implementation Steps

1. Verified that the entry page directory and components already existed in the Relume-root directory
2. Created a route file at `Relume-root/pages/entry.js` with the following content:
   ```javascript
   export { default } from '../entry';
   ```
3. Tested the page by opening it in the browser at http://localhost:3000/entry
4. Confirmed that the page rendered correctly with all components

### Directory Structure

The entry page follows the standard directory structure for product pages:

```
entry/
├── components/
│   ├── [Component files]
└── index.jsx
```

## 5000-Series Page Error Documentation

During the implementation process, we attempted to create a 5000-series page, which led to several errors and issues. This section documents these errors to prevent similar issues in the future.

### Error 1: Creating a Non-Existent Page

**Issue**: We attempted to create a 5000-series page, but this page does not exist in the original Window World LA website structure.

**Error Message**: No specific error message, but the page failed to render correctly.

**Root Cause**: The 5000-series folder does not exist in the Relume-DO-NOT-EDIT directory, which contains the original website structure. We should only implement pages that exist in the original structure.

**Solution**: Abandon the 5000-series page implementation and focus on implementing existing pages from the Relume-DO-NOT-EDIT directory.

### Error 2: Incorrect Directory Structure

**Issue**: We initially created the 5000-series directory at the root level of the project, not inside the Relume-root directory.

**Error Message**: 
```
Module not found: Can't resolve '../5000-series'
```

**Root Cause**: The route file was looking for the 5000-series directory at the same level as the pages directory, but it was created at the root level of the project.

**Solution**: Always create page directories inside the Relume-root directory, not at the root level of the project.

### Error 3: Path Resolution Issues

**Issue**: Even after moving the 5000-series directory to the correct location, the page still failed to render correctly.

**Error Message**: No specific error message, but components were missing from the rendered page.

**Root Cause**: The components were copied to the correct location, but there may have been issues with the imports or component implementations.

**Solution**: When implementing a new page, always check if it exists in the Relume-DO-NOT-EDIT directory first. If it does, follow the existing structure and component implementations. If it doesn't, do not attempt to create it.

## Lessons Learned

1. **Always Check Original Structure**: Before implementing a new page, always check if it exists in the Relume-DO-NOT-EDIT directory.
2. **Correct Directory Structure**: Always create page directories inside the Relume-root directory, not at the root level of the project.
3. **Simple Testing First**: When implementing a new page, start with a simple test page to verify that the routing works correctly before implementing the full page.
4. **Follow Existing Patterns**: Follow the patterns established in existing, working pages rather than creating new patterns.

## Next Steps

1. Update the webpage progress tracker to include the entry page
2. Create documentation for the entry page
3. Continue with implementing the remaining pages from the Relume-DO-NOT-EDIT directory

## Conclusion

The entry page has been successfully implemented and is working as expected. The errors encountered during the attempted implementation of the 5000-series page have been documented to prevent similar issues in the future.
