# Daily Development Log - 2025-05-11

## Overview

Today's focus was on implementing the 2000-Series and 3000-Series vinyl siding pages and resolving component issues related to the Relume UI library.

## Tasks Completed

### 1. 2000-Series Vinyl Siding Page Implementation

- Created the route for the 2000-series page in the Pages Router
- Verified the existence of the 2000-series component directory and files
- Identified and fixed an issue with the Faq5.jsx component
- Successfully loaded the 2000-series page at http://localhost:3007/2000-series
- Created comprehensive documentation for the 2000-series page

### 2. 3000-Series Vinyl Siding Page Implementation

- Created the directory structure for the 3000-series page
- Implemented all components based on the 2000-series components with premium-focused content
- Created the route for the 3000-series page in the Pages Router
- Successfully loaded the 3000-series page at http://localhost:3007/3000-series
- Created comprehensive documentation for the 3000-series page

### 3. Relume UI Library Integration

- Installed the Relume UI library packages: `@relume_io/relume-ui` and `@relume_io/relume-tailwind`
- Verified the tailwind.config.js file includes the Relume UI preset
- Identified that the `Card` component is not exported from the Relume UI library
- Modified components to use alternative approaches when Relume UI components are not available

## Issues Encountered and Resolutions

### 1. Card Component Import Error

- **Issue**: The Faq5.jsx component was importing a `Card` component from the Relume UI library that wasn't available.
- **Error Message**: `Attempted import error: 'Card' is not exported from '@relume_io/relume-ui' (imported as 'Card')`.
- **Resolution**: Modified the Faq5.jsx component to remove the `Card` import and replace `<Card>` elements with styled `<div>` elements to maintain the same visual appearance.
- **Modified Code**:
  ```jsx
  // Before
  <Card>
    <AccordionItem value="item-0" className="border-none px-5 md:px-6">
      ...
    </AccordionItem>
  </Card>

  // After
  <div className="border rounded-md shadow-sm">
    <AccordionItem value="item-0" className="border-none px-5 md:px-6">
      ...
    </AccordionItem>
  </div>
  ```

### 2. Directory Not Found Error

- **Issue**: When checking if the 3000-series directory existed, received an error: `Cannot find path 'C:\Users\IvoD\repos\react-win-dir\Relume-root\3000-series' because it does not exist.`
- **Resolution**: Created the directory structure using `mkdir "3000-series\components"` command.

### 3. PowerShell Directory Listing Error

- **Issue**: When trying to list the contents of the 2000-series directory using `dir "2000-series" /s`, received an error: `Second path fragment must not be a drive or UNC name.`
- **Resolution**: Used PowerShell's `Get-ChildItem -Path "2000-series" -Recurse` command instead, which provided the correct directory listing.

### 4. File Already Exists Error

- **Issue**: When trying to create the route file for the 3000-series page, received an error: `File already exists: c:\Users\IvoD\repos\react-win-dir\Relume-root\pages\3000-series.js`
- **Resolution**: The file already existed, so no action was needed. This indicates that the route was already set up correctly.

### 5. Connection Refused Error

- **Issue**: Initially, when trying to access the page at http://localhost:3007/3000-series, the connection was refused.
- **Resolution**: Restarted the development server using `yarn dev` to apply all changes and ensure the server was running on the correct port.

## Next Steps

1. Continue implementing the remaining vinyl siding series pages (4000-series, etc.)
2. Ensure consistent styling and functionality across all product detail pages
3. Verify all components are properly importing from the Relume UI library
4. Update the documentation index to include the new vinyl siding page documentation
