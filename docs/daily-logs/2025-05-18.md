## Vertex AI Image Generation - Successful Setup

**Objective**: Successfully configure and run the Vertex AI image generation test script (`Relume-root/src/lib/vertex-ai/test-image-generation.ts`).

**Key Activities & Outcomes**:

- **Troubleshooting Authentication & Permissions**:
  - Switched Google Cloud Project to `windows-doors-website-dir-v2`.
  - Configured a new service account: `windows-doors-v2@windows-doors-website-dir-v2.iam.gserviceaccount.com`.
  - Updated the service account key file (`vertex-ai-imagen-service-account-key.json`) with the new credentials.
  - Updated `.env.local` with the new `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT` and ensured `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` pointed to the absolute path of the key file.
  - Verified and ensured the service account has `Vertex AI Administrator` (and `Owner`) roles in the `windows-doors-website-dir-v2` project via IAM.
  - Confirmed the Vertex AI API is enabled for the `windows-doors-website-dir-v2` project.

- **Build Process Refinement**:
  - Updated the `esbuild` command to mark Google Cloud SDKs as external to prevent bundling issues with ESM:

    ```bash
    npx esbuild Relume-root/src/lib/vertex-ai/test-image-generation.ts --bundle --outfile=dist/test-image-generation.mjs --platform=node --format=esm --external:dotenv --external:google-auth-library --external:@google-cloud/vertexai --color=true
    ```

- **Successful Execution**:
  - The script `dist/test-image-generation.mjs` ran successfully using Node.js:

    ```bash
    node --no-warnings dist/test-image-generation.mjs
    ```

- **Documentation**: Created comprehensive documentation for this setup. See:
  - [Vertex AI Feature Documentation](../../features/vertex-ai-image-generation.md)
  - [Vertex AI Setup Guide](../../processes/vertex-ai-setup-guide.md)

**Summary**: After several iterations of troubleshooting involving service accounts, IAM permissions, API enablement, and esbuild configuration, the Vertex AI image generation script was successfully executed. The key was ensuring the correct project context, service account permissions, and handling of external Node modules during the build.

## Admin UI Implementation and Sample Images System

**Objective**: Implement the admin UI for Supabase operations and create a sample images system for populating pages with placeholder images.

**Key Activities & Outcomes**:

### Admin UI Implementation

1. **Admin Dashboard**
   - Added a new Dashboard tab to the admin UI
   - Created a dashboard with statistics, sample page link, and documentation link
   - Set the dashboard as the default active tab

2. **Content Management**
   - Implemented a placeholder ContentCrud component for managing content
   - Implemented a placeholder ContentForm component for editing content
   - Connected the components to the admin UI

3. **Image Management**
   - Implemented a placeholder ImageManagement component for managing images
   - Added functionality for displaying, uploading, and deleting images
   - Connected the component to the admin UI

4. **Content Engine**
   - Implemented a placeholder ContentEngine component for generating text and images
   - Added tabs for text generation and image generation
   - Connected the component to the admin UI

### Sample Images System

1. **Sample Images Utilities**
   - Created a use-sample-images.ts utility for accessing sample images
   - Implemented functions for getting random images and specific numbers of images
   - Added support for different image categories (windows, doors, siding, roofing)

2. **Sample Image Components**
   - Created a SampleHeroImage component for displaying hero images with titles
   - Created a SampleImageGallery component for displaying grids of images
   - Created a SampleProductCard component for displaying product cards with images

3. **Sample Page**
   - Created a sample page that demonstrates how to use the sample image components
   - Added the page at /sample-page
   - Added a link to the page from the admin dashboard

### Documentation

1. **Admin UI Documentation**
   - Created an admin-ui-guide.md document that explains how to use the admin UI
   - Added the document to the documentation index

2. **Sample Images Documentation**
   - Created a sample-images-usage.md document that explains how to use the sample images system
   - Added the document to the documentation index

3. **Documentation Index Update**
   - Updated the main documentation index to include the new documentation
   - Added new sections for Admin and Sample Images
   - Updated the last updated date

**Next Steps**:

1. **Test Admin UI**
   - Test all components of the admin UI to ensure they work correctly
   - Fix any issues that arise during testing

2. **Integrate Sample Images**
   - Integrate the sample image components into the main pages of the website
   - Replace placeholder images with sample images

3. **Prepare for Content Engine**
   - Research Google Cloud services for content generation
   - Plan the integration of the content engine with the admin UI

**Summary**: Successfully implemented the admin UI with placeholder functionality for managing content, images, and generating content. Created a sample images system to make it easy to populate pages with placeholder images until real images are available. Added comprehensive documentation for both systems.
