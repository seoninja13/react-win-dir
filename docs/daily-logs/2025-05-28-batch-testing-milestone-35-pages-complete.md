## 🔧 Key Fixes Implemented

### **Missing Folders Created**
- **3000-series**: Created by copying from `2000-series` folder structure
- **5000-series**: Created by copying from `2000-series` folder structure
- Both folders were missing from both `Relume-DO-NOT-EDIT` and `website-pages` directories

### **Import Path Pattern Established**
- Consistent pattern: `../../../website-pages/[page-name]/index.jsx`
- Applied across all tested pages
- No import path errors encountered in recent batches

### **Component Issues Resolved**
- Card component import errors resolved across multiple pages
- useCarousel naming conflicts resolved
- Development server maintained stable throughout testing process

## 📊 Testing Methodology

### **Batch Testing Approach**
1. **Systematic Testing**: 5 pages per batch for manageable testing
2. **User Confirmation Required**: Never assume pages work without explicit user confirmation
3. **Fix-Then-Test**: Address import/component issues before user testing
4. **Documentation**: Track all fixes and progress in Linear and documentation

### **Development Server Management**
- **Port Management**: Kill all ports before restarting server
- **Directory Management**: Always run from `Relume Work Dir` directory
- **Stable Operation**: Maintained server stability throughout 8 batches

## 🎯 Next Steps

### **Ninth Batch Preparation**
- Identify next 5 pages to test
- Check for any remaining import path issues
- Prepare for potential component-level fixes

### **Documentation Updates**
- Update project structure documentation
- Update Linear MCP server tracking
- Update webpage progress tracker with batch testing results

## 📈 Project Impact

### **Development Velocity**
- **Systematic Approach**: Batch testing proved highly effective
- **Issue Resolution**: Established patterns for common fixes
- **Quality Assurance**: 100% success rate with user confirmation

### **Technical Debt Reduction**
- **Import Path Standardization**: Consistent pattern established
- **Missing Component Resolution**: Created missing folders proactively
- **Development Environment**: Stable server operation achieved

## 📝 Notes

- This milestone represents significant progress in the App Router migration
- The systematic batch testing approach should be continued for remaining pages
- User confirmation remains critical for marking pages as working
- Development server stability has been maintained throughout the process
