**Task:** Implement the casement windows page

## Overview

This document details the implementation of the casement windows page for the Windows Doors CA website. The casement windows page showcases casement window products, their features, benefits, and design options.

## Implementation Details

The casement windows page was successfully implemented by creating a route file that points to the existing casement page component. The implementation was straightforward as the casement directory and components already existed in the Relume-root directory.

### Implementation Steps

1. Verified that the casement page directory and components already existed in the Relume-root directory
2. Confirmed that the route file at `Relume-root/pages/casement.js` already existed with the following content:
   ```javascript
   export { default } from '../casement';
   ```
3. Tested the page by opening it in the browser at http://localhost:3000/casement
4. Confirmed that the page rendered correctly with all components

### Directory Structure

The casement windows page follows the standard directory structure for product pages:

```
casement/
├── components/
│   ├── [Component files]
└── index.jsx
```

## Issues and Solutions

No issues were encountered during the implementation of the casement windows page. The implementation was straightforward because:

1. The casement page directory and components already existed in the Relume-root directory
2. The route file already existed with the correct export statement
3. All components rendered correctly without errors

## Lessons Learned

1. **Check Existing Files**: Always check if the page directory, components, and route files already exist before creating new ones.
2. **Follow Established Patterns**: Follow the patterns established in existing, working pages for creating route files.
3. **Test Thoroughly**: Always test the page in the browser to ensure all components render correctly.

## Next Steps

1. Update the webpage progress tracker to include the casement windows page
2. Create documentation for the casement windows page
3. Continue with implementing the remaining pages from the Relume-DO-NOT-EDIT directory

## Conclusion

The casement windows page has been successfully implemented and is working as expected. The implementation was straightforward, with no issues encountered.
