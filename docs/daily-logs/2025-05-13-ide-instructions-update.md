# IDE Instructions Update

**Date:** May 13, 2025  
**Author:** Augment Agent  
**Task:** Update IDE Instructions with Common Troubleshooting Scenarios and Case Studies sections

## Overview

This document details the updates made to the IDE Instructions file to include information about common troubleshooting scenarios and case studies based on our experience with the 5000-series page implementation.

## Implementation Details

The IDE Instructions file was updated to include two new sections:

1. **Common Troubleshooting Scenarios**: This section provides guidance on how to troubleshoot common issues encountered during development, including:
   - Accordion Component Issues
   - Connection Refused Errors
   - Import Path Issues
   - Project Structure Inconsistencies

2. **Case Studies**: This section provides a detailed case study of the 5000-series page implementation, highlighting the troubleshooting process and the importance of documentation.

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Common Troubleshooting Scenarios Section

The Common Troubleshooting Scenarios section includes the following subsections:

#### Accordion Component Issues

This subsection provides guidance on how to properly implement accordion components, including:
- Importing all necessary components from @relume_io/relume-ui
- Using the correct component structure
- Checking existing implementations for reference

#### Connection Refused Errors

This subsection provides guidance on how to troubleshoot connection refused errors, including:
- Killing all Node.js processes
- Starting the development server from the correct directory
- Checking port configuration
- Verifying route files

#### Import Path Issues

This subsection provides guidance on how to troubleshoot import path issues, including:
- Verifying relative paths
- Checking for path inconsistencies
- Using absolute imports when possible
- Testing imports incrementally

#### Project Structure Inconsistencies

This subsection highlights potential inconsistencies between documentation and actual project structure, including:
- src/app directory location
- Import path resolution
- Documenting inconsistencies

### 2. Added Case Studies Section

The Case Studies section includes a detailed case study of the 5000-series page implementation, highlighting:
- Issue Identification
- Comparative Analysis
- Solution Implementation
- Comprehensive Documentation

The case study demonstrates the importance of:
- Checking existing implementations before creating new components
- Comparing problematic components with working versions
- Following established patterns for component structure
- Documenting all issues and solutions for future reference

### 3. Updated Table of Contents

The Table of Contents was updated to include the new sections:
- 11. Common Troubleshooting Scenarios
- 12. Case Studies

### 4. Updated Last Updated Section

The Last Updated section was updated to reflect the changes made:
"Last Updated: May 13, 2025 (Added Common Troubleshooting Scenarios and Case Studies sections)"

## Lessons Learned

1. **Documentation is Crucial**: Documenting troubleshooting processes and solutions is essential for future reference and for helping other developers avoid similar issues.
2. **Comparative Analysis**: When troubleshooting component issues, comparing with working versions of the same component from other pages can quickly identify the problem.
3. **Consistent Component Structure**: Following established patterns for component structure is important for maintaining consistency across the project.
4. **Comprehensive Documentation**: Documenting all aspects of the implementation process, including issues encountered and their solutions, helps build a knowledge base for the project.

## Next Steps

1. Continue to update the IDE Instructions file with additional troubleshooting scenarios and case studies as they arise.
2. Ensure that all developers are aware of the updated IDE Instructions file and the new sections.
3. Consider creating a more comprehensive troubleshooting guide that includes additional scenarios and solutions.
