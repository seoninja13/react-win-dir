# Daily Log: Warranty Page Implementation

## Date: May 13, 2025

## Overview

Today, I implemented the Warranty page for the Windows Doors CA website. The page follows the T4 (Standard Informational Page) template and provides detailed information about Window World's limited lifetime warranty for replacement windows and doors.

## Tasks Completed

1. Created the route file for the Warranty page at `src/app/warranty/page.tsx`
2. Verified that the Warranty page components already existed in the Relume-root directory
3. Tested the page by opening it in the browser at http://localhost:3000/warranty
4. Created documentation for the Warranty page at `Docs/pages/warranty-page-documentation.md`
5. Updated the webpage progress tracker to include the Warranty page
6. Created this daily log entry

## Implementation Details

### Route File Creation

The route file for the Warranty page was created at `src/app/warranty/page.tsx` with the following content:

```typescript
'use client';

import React from 'react';
import WarrantyPage from '../../../warranty/index.jsx';

export default function Warranty() {
  return <WarrantyPage />;
}
```

This follows the same pattern as other pages in the project, importing the main component from the Relume-root directory and rendering it.

### Component Structure

The Warranty page uses the following components from the Relume-root directory:

1. **Navbar10**: Navigation bar component
2. **Header44**: Header component with title "Lifetime Warranty Promise"
3. **Layout3**: Main content section with introduction to the warranty
4. **Layout240**: Features section with comprehensive warranty coverage
5. **Layout239**: Details section with warranty information
6. **Layout250**: Additional information section about what the warranty covers and doesn't cover
7. **Cta39**: Call-to-action section for warranty questions
8. **Faq6**: FAQ section with accordion-style questions and answers
9. **Footer4**: Footer component with links and contact information

### Testing

The Warranty page was tested in the browser and verified to be working correctly. All components rendered as expected, and the page matched the design of other pages in the project.

## Documentation Updates

1. Created a detailed documentation file for the Warranty page at `Docs/pages/warranty-page-documentation.md`
2. Updated the webpage progress tracker to include the Warranty page with a status of "Complete" for implementation and "Verified" for testing
3. Added a link to the Warranty page documentation in the Detailed Page Reports section of the webpage progress tracker
4. Updated the "Last Updated" timestamp in the webpage progress tracker

## Issues and Solutions

During the implementation of the Warranty page, I encountered a significant issue with server-side rendering:

### Server-Side Rendering Issue

**Problem**: The Warranty page was returning a server-side rendering error with the message "Element type is invalid: expected a string (for built-in components) or a class/function (for composite components) but got: undefined." After investigation, I found that the error was related to the `Card` component being imported from the @relume_io/relume-ui library but not being exported by that library.

**Error Message**:
```
Attempted import error: 'Card' is not exported from '@relume_io/relume-ui' (imported as 'Card').
```

**Root Cause**: The `Card` component was being imported in both the `Cta39.jsx` and `Faq6.jsx` components, but this component is not actually exported from the @relume_io/relume-ui library.

**Solution**: I fixed the issue by:

1. Adding the "use client" directive to the warranty/index.jsx file to ensure it works with server-side rendering
2. Removing the Card import from the components:
   - In `Cta39.jsx`, changed `import { Button, Card } from "@relume_io/relume-ui";` to `import { Button } from "@relume_io/relume-ui";`
   - In `Faq6.jsx`, removed `Card` from the import statement
3. Replacing all instances of the `<Card>` component with a `<div>` element with similar styling:
   - Added `className="border rounded-lg shadow-md"` or `className="border rounded-lg shadow-sm"` to the divs to maintain similar appearance

This approach allowed us to keep the original warranty page structure and components while fixing the import error. The key was identifying which component was causing the issue and replacing it with a standard HTML element with similar styling.

### Lessons Learned

1. When components use client-side features like useState, useMediaQuery, or animation libraries, they need to be properly marked with the "use client" directive to work correctly with server-side rendering.
2. Always check the error messages carefully to identify the specific component or import causing the issue.
3. When encountering import errors, verify that the component is actually exported from the library you're importing from.
4. It's often simpler to replace a problematic third-party component with a standard HTML element with similar styling than to create a completely new implementation.
5. When troubleshooting server-side rendering issues, it's important to check both the component implementation and the route configuration.
6. The Next.js App Router requires careful attention to the directory structure and file naming conventions to ensure pages are properly generated.
7. When encountering errors with specific components, try to isolate the issue by creating a simplified version of the component to identify the exact cause.
8. Always add the "use client" directive to components that use client-side features, even if they're imported into other components that already have the directive.
9. Pay attention to build warnings, as they often indicate issues that will cause runtime errors.
10. When fixing component issues, make minimal changes to maintain the original design and functionality.

## Next Steps

Continue with implementing the remaining pages according to the project plan, following the same workflow:

1. Create the route file for the next page
2. Verify that the page components exist in the Relume-root directory
3. Test the page in the browser
4. Create documentation for the page
5. Update the webpage progress tracker
6. Create a daily log entry
