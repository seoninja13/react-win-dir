# Daily Log - May 28, 2025: Project Structure Documentation Continued

## Overview

Today we continued our work on improving the project structure documentation. We completed several key documents that provide comprehensive guidance on the project structure, component organization, and build/deployment process.

## Tasks Completed

1. **Updated Directory Structure Policy**
   - Updated the policy to reflect the actual project structure
   - Changed references from "Relume-root" to "Relume Work Dir"
   - Added detailed file placement guidelines
   - Added Mermaid diagrams for visualization
   - Updated related documentation references

2. **Created Component Organization Documentation**
   - Documented different component types
   - Defined component directory structure
   - Established naming conventions
   - Explained component hierarchy
   - Provided best practices for component composition
   - Added examples and guidelines

3. **Created Visual Project Map**
   - Developed comprehensive visual representations of the project structure
   - Created Mermaid diagrams for different parts of the codebase
   - Visualized relationships between components
   - Illustrated data flow through the application
   - Mapped the build process

4. **Documented Build and Deployment Structure**
   - Explained the build process and configuration
   - Documented the build output structure
   - Described the deployment process
   - Outlined environment configuration
   - Provided troubleshooting guidance

## Issues Encountered

### 1. Complex Directory Structure

- **Issue**: The project has a complex directory structure with many nested directories
- **Resolution**: Created visual diagrams to make the structure easier to understand

### 2. Inconsistent Naming

- **Issue**: Inconsistent naming between documentation and actual directories
- **Resolution**: Updated all documentation to use consistent naming based on the actual directory names

### 3. Incomplete Build Documentation

- **Issue**: Limited documentation on the build and deployment process
- **Resolution**: Created comprehensive documentation on the build process, configuration, and output

## Next Steps

1. **Update Existing Documentation**
   - Review and update all existing documentation to use consistent terminology
   - Add cross-references between related documents
   - Ensure all documentation includes last updated dates

2. **Create Project Structure Checklist**
   - Develop a checklist for ensuring that new code follows the project structure guidelines
   - Make it easy to use during code reviews
   - Integrate with the pre-commit process

3. **Document Integration with Linear**
   - Update project structure documentation to include integration with Linear
   - Document how Linear issues should be organized to reflect the project structure
   - Create guidelines for using Linear labels that align with project structure

4. **Create Documentation Index**
   - Create a comprehensive index of all project structure documentation
   - Organize documentation by category
   - Add brief descriptions of each document

## Notes

- The project structure documentation is now much more comprehensive and accurate
- Visual diagrams have significantly improved the clarity of the documentation
- The file placement guide should help maintain consistency in the project structure
- The component organization documentation provides clear guidelines for developers
