# Daily Log: Google GenAI SDK Testing - May 16, 2025

> **Breadcrumb Navigation**: [README.md](../../README.md) > [Documentation](../index.md) > [Daily Logs](./index.md) > 2025-05-16

## Overview

Today's focus was on testing and implementing the new `@google/genai` SDK for image generation as part of our Google Generative AI Integration priority. We created several test scripts, documented our findings, and established a path forward for implementation.

## Tasks Completed

1. **SDK Testing and Documentation**
   - Created test scripts for the new `@google/genai` SDK
   - Tested both Google AI Studio and Vertex AI authentication methods
   - Documented findings, challenges, and solutions
   - Created comprehensive implementation guide

2. **Authentication Testing**
   - Tested Google AI Studio API key authentication (encountered 401 Unauthorized)
   - Tested Vertex AI with Application Default Credentials
   - Tested Vertex AI with service account authentication
   - Created API key verification script

3. **Error Handling Implementation**
   - Implemented comprehensive error handling patterns
   - Added categorization of common errors
   - Created troubleshooting steps for each error type
   - Added rate limiting implementation for quota management

4. **Documentation Updates**
   - Created `google-genai-sdk-implementation.md` - Detailed implementation guide
   - Created `implementation-updates-2025-05-16.md` - Status update
   - Updated project documentation to reflect current state

## Challenges Encountered

1. **API Key Authentication Issues**
   - Google AI Studio API key returned 401 Unauthorized errors
   - Need to generate a new API key from Google AI Studio

2. **Quota Limitations**
   - Vertex AI image generation hit quota limits
   - Error: "Quota exceeded for aiplatform.googleapis.com/generate_content_requests_per_minute_per_project_per_base_model"
   - Need to implement more conservative rate limiting

3. **Model Availability**
   - Some models weren't available in certain regions
   - Implemented region and model fallback mechanisms

## Solutions Implemented

1. **Authentication**
   - Created service account authentication test script
   - Documented authentication methods and best practices
   - Provided clear steps for setting up authentication

2. **Rate Limiting**
   - Implemented conservative rate limiting (10 req/min instead of 50)
   - Added exponential backoff for retries
   - Added initial delay to avoid quota issues

3. **Error Handling**
   - Added comprehensive error categorization
   - Created detailed troubleshooting steps
   - Implemented fallback mechanisms for different configurations

## Next Steps

1. **Generate New API Key**
   - Create a new API key from Google AI Studio
   - Update `.env.local` with the new key

2. **Implement Rate Limiting**
   - Add conservative rate limiting for Vertex AI
   - Monitor quota usage in Google Cloud Console
   - Request quota increase if needed for production use

3. **Integration**
   - Connect the new SDK with the existing batch processing system
   - Integrate with frontend components
   - Implement production-ready error handling
