## Critical Issues Fixed

### ðŸ”§ Logging System Error Resolution

**Problem:** 500 Internal Server Error on POST `/api/logs`
- Error: "supabaseUrl is required" 
- Environment variables not loading properly

**Root Cause:** Environment file (`.env.local`) was in wrong location
- Located in: `Relume Work Dir/env-files/.env.local`
- Should be in: `Relume Work Dir/.env.local`

**Solution:**
1. Copied `.env.local` to correct root location
2. Restarted development server
3. Confirmed environment variables loading: "Loaded env from C:\Users\IvoD\repos\react-win-dir\Relume Work Dir\.env.local"
4. Updated API route column mapping to match Supabase logs table schema

### ðŸ”§ Route Structure Corrections

**Problem:** 404 errors on incorrect route assumptions
- `/windows/double-hung` â†’ Correct: `/double-hung` (root level)
- `/windows/wood-windows` â†’ Correct: `/wood-windows` (root level)

**Solution:** 
1. Identified correct route structure from existing App Router pages
2. Created missing `/wood-windows` App Router page
3. Updated documentation with correct route patterns

### ðŸ”§ Import Path Fixes

**Problem:** Module resolution errors in `/casement` page
- Import paths pointing to non-existent `../../../casement/components/`
- Should point to `../../../website-pages/casement/components/`

**Solution:** Updated all import statements to correct website-pages directory structure

## Technical Details

### Environment Configuration
- **Fixed**: `.env.local` file location and loading
- **Confirmed**: Supabase URL and service role key properly loaded
- **Result**: Logging API now functional

### Database Schema Alignment
- **Updated**: API route to match Supabase logs table columns
- **Mapping**: `context` â†’ `details`, `route` â†’ `url`, `component` â†’ `source`

### Development Server Status
- **Port**: 3000 (localhost:3000)
- **Status**: Stable throughout testing session
- **Logging**: Functional and storing to Supabase

## Documentation Updates

### Updated Files
1. **`Docs/tracking/webpage-progress-tracker.md`**
   - Updated total pages: 35 â†’ 53
   - Added January 27, 2025 session batches
   - Documented fixes and route corrections

2. **Created**: `Docs/daily-logs/2025-01-27-batch-testing-session-18-pages.md` (this file)

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions Required
1. **Fix Linear Integration Issues** - Technical problems identified with Linear MCP
2. **Establish Linear-based Tracking** - Migrate from documentation to Linear issues
3. **Continue Batch Testing** - Additional pages remain to be tested

### Linear Integration Plan
- **Issue Identified**: GraphQL validation errors in Linear queries
- **Status**: Technical investigation required
- **Goal**: Establish Linear as primary tracking system

## Success Metrics

- **Pages Tested**: 18 pages
- **Success Rate**: 100% (18/18 working)
