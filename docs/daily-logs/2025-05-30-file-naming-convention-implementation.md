# Daily Log: May 30, 2025 - File Naming Convention Implementation

> **Breadcrumb Navigation**: [README.md](../../README.md) > [Documentation](../index.md) > [Daily Logs](./index.md) > 2025-05-30 File Naming Convention Implementation

## Summary

Today we implemented a standardized file naming convention for the Windows Doors CA website project. This convention uses hyphenated path names instead of directory separators and requires a concise 5-7 word description for each file. This approach makes files easier to find, reference, and prevents potential duplication issues that might occur with hierarchical path references.

## Tasks Completed

### 1. Created File Naming Convention Documentation

- Created comprehensive documentation in `Docs/processes/file-naming-convention.md`
- Defined rules for using hyphenated path names
- Established requirements for concise file descriptions
- Provided examples of properly named files
- Added implementation guidelines

### 2. Updated Project Requirements

- Added the file naming convention to the critical project requirements in README.md
- Updated the processes index to include the new file naming convention document
- Established the convention as a mandatory requirement for all new files

### 3. Applied Convention to Recent Files

- Renamed and described files created for the Code Modularity Tools feature
- Ensured all descriptions are limited to 5-7 words
- Verified that descriptions clearly state the file's purpose

## Implementation Details

### File Naming Convention Rules

1. **Use Hyphenated Path Names**: Replace directory separators (slashes) with hyphens in file references
2. **Use Kebab Case**: Use lowercase letters and separate words with hyphens
3. **Include Path Context**: Include abbreviated path information in the filename
4. **Be Descriptive**: Choose names that clearly indicate the file's purpose
5. **Be Consistent**: Apply the same naming pattern across all files

### File Description Requirements

Every file must have a concise description that:

1. **Is Limited to 5-7 Words**: Keep descriptions brief but informative
2. **Clearly States Purpose**: Describe what the file does, not what it is
3. **Avoids Redundancy**: Don't repeat information already in the filename
4. **Uses Action Words**: Begin with verbs when describing functionality
5. **Is Documented**: Include the description in relevant documentation

### Example Renamed Files

| Original Path | Hyphenated Name | Description |
|---------------|-----------------|-------------|
| `docs/features/code-modularity-tools.md` | `docs-features-code-modularity-tools.md` | Code analysis and refactoring documentation |
| `Relume Work Dir/scripts/code-modularity/index.js` | `relume-workdir-scripts-code-modularity-index.js` | Main entry point for modularity tools |
| `Relume Work Dir/scripts/code-modularity/code-analyzer.js` | `relume-workdir-scripts-code-modularity-code-analyzer.js` | Analyzes code complexity and structure |

## Next Steps

1. **Apply Convention to Existing Files**: Gradually rename existing files to follow the convention
2. **Update Documentation References**: Update references in documentation to use the new naming convention
3. **Create Automation Tool**: Develop a tool to automatically generate hyphenated names and validate descriptions
4. **Add to Code Review Checklist**: Include file naming convention compliance in code review checklist

## Notes

The file naming convention is now a critical project requirement. All new files must follow this convention, and existing files should be gradually renamed to comply with it. This will improve consistency, clarity, and ease of reference across the project.
