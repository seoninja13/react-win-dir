# Daily Log - May 28, 2025

## Overview

Today's focus was on creating a comprehensive plan for enhancing our development documentation to better support AI-assisted development workflows. We identified gaps in our current documentation related to the "Vibe Coding Tips" and created a detailed implementation plan to address these gaps. We also explored the Linear MCP server for project management integration and began implementing the first phase of our documentation plan.

## Tasks Completed

1. **Analysis of Current Documentation**
   - Reviewed existing documentation structure
   - Identified gaps related to "Vibe Coding Tips"
   - Analyzed areas for improvement

2. **Created AI-Enhanced Development Documentation Plan**
   - Developed a phased implementation approach
   - Created a detailed timeline for implementation
   - Defined success metrics for the documentation

3. **Explored Linear MCP Server Integration**
   - Researched Linear MCP server capabilities
   - Identified integration points with our workflow
   - Added Linear integration to our documentation plan

4. **Created Initial Documentation**
   - Created `docs/processes/ai-agent-rules.md`
   - Created `docs/integrations/linear-integration.md`
   - Created `docs/planning/ai-documentation-implementation-plan.md`
   - Updated `docs/priority-list.md` with new documentation plan

## Issues Encountered

### 1. Limited Information on Linear MCP Server

- **Issue**: Limited detailed documentation available for the Linear MCP server
- **Resolution**: Used web search and available resources to gather information about capabilities and integration points

### 2. Integration Complexity

- **Issue**: Complex integration points between AI workflows, Linear, and existing processes
- **Resolution**: Created detailed workflow diagrams using Mermaid to visualize the integration points

## Next Steps

1. **Continue Documentation Implementation**
   - Create `docs/processes/commit-standards.md`
   - Create `docs/processes/effective-ai-interaction.md`
   - Create `docs/testing/pre-commit-testing.md`

2. **Set Up Linear MCP Server**
   - Install and configure Linear MCP server
   - Set up Linear API key
   - Test integration with our workflow

3. **Create Mermaid Diagrams**
   - Create additional workflow diagrams for all processes
   - Ensure diagrams accurately represent the integration points

4. **Update Existing Documentation**
   - Update related documentation to reference new guidelines
   - Ensure consistent terminology and approaches

## Notes

- The Linear MCP server provides a powerful way to integrate project management with AI workflows
- Mermaid diagrams are essential for visualizing complex workflows
- The documentation plan should be flexible to accommodate new insights and requirements
- We should consider creating a dedicated documentation section for AI-assisted development
