# Daily Log: May 11, 2025 - Contact Page Implementation

## Summary

Today's focus was on implementing and testing the Contact page for the Windows Doors CA website. The Contact page is a contact page template (T7 template) that provides a form for users to contact the company, along with contact information and a map.

## Tasks Completed

### 1. Contact Page Implementation

- Created routes for the Contact page at both `/contact` and `/contact-us` paths
- Verified that all components in the Contact page are working correctly
- Tested the Contact page to ensure it renders correctly
- Confirmed that there are no Card component issues in the Contact page components

### 2. Documentation Updates

- Updated the Webpage Progress Tracker to reflect the completion of the Contact page
- Updated the T7 template status to "Complete"
- Created this daily log entry to document the implementation process

## Implementation Details

### Route Creation

Created routes for the Contact page by adding new files at `Relume-root/pages/contact.js` and `Relume-root/pages/contact-us.js` that export the Contact component:

```javascript
export { default } from '../contact';
```

This ensures that both `/contact` and `/contact-us` URLs will render the same Contact page component.

### Component Structure

The Contact page consists of the following components:

1. Navbar10 - Navigation bar component
2. Header44 - Main header component
3. Header9 - Secondary header component
4. Layout3 - Content layout component
5. Cta26 - Call to action component
6. Layout10 - Content layout component
7. Contact14 - Contact form component
8. Cta13 - Call to action component
9. Footer4 - Footer component

All components were verified to be working correctly without any Card component issues that we encountered in previous pages.

### Testing

After implementing the routes, we tested the Contact page by:

1. Opening the page in the browser at both http://localhost:3002/contact and http://localhost:3002/contact-us
2. Checking the console for any errors
3. Verifying that the page renders correctly with all components
4. Confirming that both routes display the same content

## Issues Encountered

No significant issues were encountered during the implementation of the Contact page. Unlike the Windows and Installation pages, the Contact page did not have any Card component issues that needed to be fixed.

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Testing**: Continue testing the Contact page to ensure all components render correctly and all functionality works as expected.

2. **Implement Internal Links**: Implement and test all internal links on the Contact page.

3. **Rail Room Integration**: Complete the integration with Rail Room for the Contact page.

4. **Documentation**: Create detailed documentation for the Contact page, including component structure, content, and functionality.
