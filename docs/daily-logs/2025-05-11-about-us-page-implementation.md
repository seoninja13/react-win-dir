# Daily Log: May 11, 2025 - About Us Page Implementation

## Summary

Today's focus was on implementing and testing the About Us page for the Windows Doors CA website. The About Us page is a standard informational page (T4 template) that provides information about the company, its mission, values, and team.

## Tasks Completed

### 1. About Us Page Implementation

- Created routes for the About Us page at both `/about` and `/about-us` paths
- Verified that all components in the About page are working correctly
- Tested the About Us page to ensure it renders correctly
- Confirmed that there are no Card component issues in the About page components

### 2. Documentation Updates

- Updated the Webpage Progress Tracker to reflect the completion of the About Us page
- Created this daily log entry to document the implementation process

## Implementation Details

### Route Creation

Created routes for the About Us page by adding new files at `Relume-root/pages/about.js` and `Relume-root/pages/about-us.js` that export the About component:

```javascript
export { default } from '../about';
```

This ensures that both `/about` and `/about-us` URLs will render the same About page component.

### Component Structure

The About page consists of the following components:

1. Navbar10 - Navigation bar component
2. Header49 - Main header component
3. Header5 - Secondary header component
4. Layout24 - Content layout component
5. Layout10 - Content layout with mission statement
6. Layout27 - Content layout component
7. Layout1 - Content layout component
8. Layout6 - Content layout component
9. Contact16 - Contact information component
10. Layout10_1 - Additional content layout component
11. Logo4 - Logo display component
12. Footer4 - Footer component

All components were verified to be working correctly without any Card component issues that we encountered in previous pages.

### Testing

After implementing the routes, we tested the About Us page by:

1. Opening the page in the browser at both http://localhost:3002/about and http://localhost:3002/about-us
2. Checking the console for any errors
3. Verifying that the page renders correctly with all components
4. Confirming that both routes display the same content

## Issues Encountered

No significant issues were encountered during the implementation of the About Us page. Unlike the Windows and Installation pages, the About page did not have any Card component issues that needed to be fixed.

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Testing**: Continue testing the About Us page to ensure all components render correctly and all functionality works as expected.

2. **Implement Internal Links**: Implement and test all internal links on the About Us page.

3. **Rail Room Integration**: Complete the integration with Rail Room for the About Us page.

4. **Documentation**: Create detailed documentation for the About Us page, including component structure, content, and functionality.
