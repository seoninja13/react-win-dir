# Daily Log: May 11, 2025 - Roofing Page Implementation

## Summary

Today's focus was on implementing and testing the Roofing page for the Windows Doors CA website. The Roofing page is a product/service category page template (T2 template) that provides an overview of roofing products, featured roofing types, benefits, and call-to-action sections.

## Tasks Completed

### 1. Roofing Page Implementation

- Created a route for the Roofing page at `/roofing` path
- Verified that all components in the Roofing page are working correctly
- Tested the Roofing page to ensure it renders correctly
- Confirmed that there are no Card component issues in the Roofing page components

### 2. Documentation Updates

- Created this daily log entry to document the implementation process

## Implementation Details

### Route Creation

Created a route for the Roofing page by adding a new file at `Relume-root/pages/roofing.js` that exports the Roofing component:

```javascript
export { default } from '../roofing';
```

### Component Structure

The Roofing page consists of the following components:

1. Navbar10 - Navigation bar component
2. Header47 - Main header component
3. Header26 - Secondary header component
4. Layout3 - Content layout component
5. Layout242 - Content layout component
6. Layout3_1 - Content layout component
7. Layout249 - Content layout component
8. Gallery1 - Gallery component
9. Layout10 - Content layout component
10. Layout4 - Content layout component
11. Faq3 - FAQ component
12. Footer4 - Footer component

All components were verified to be working correctly without any Card component issues that we encountered in previous pages.

### Testing

After implementing the route, we tested the Roofing page by:

1. Opening the page in the browser at http://localhost:3002/roofing
2. Checking the console for any errors
3. Verifying that the page renders correctly with all components

## Issues Encountered

No significant issues were encountered during the implementation of the Roofing page. Unlike the Windows and Installation pages, the Roofing page did not have any Card component issues that needed to be fixed.

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Testing**: Continue testing the Roofing page to ensure all components render correctly and all functionality works as expected.

2. **Implement Internal Links**: Implement and test all internal links on the Roofing page.

3. **Rail Room Integration**: Complete the integration with Rail Room for the Roofing page.

4. **Documentation**: Create detailed documentation for the Roofing page, including component structure, content, and functionality.
