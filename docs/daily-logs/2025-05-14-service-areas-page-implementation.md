# Daily Log: May 14, 2025 - Service Areas Page Implementation

## Summary

Today's focus was on implementing the Service Areas page using the Next.js App Router approach. This page provides information about the areas served by Windows Doors CA, including cities, counties, and a service area map.

## Tasks Completed

### 1. Service Areas Page Implementation

- Created the Service Areas page using the App Router approach
- Implemented the page following the established pattern for other pages
- Tested the page to ensure it works correctly
- Documented the implementation process

### 2. Implementation Details

#### Directory Structure

Created the following directory structure:

```
Relume-root/src/app/
└── service-areas/
    └── page.tsx
```

#### Page Component

Created the Service Areas page component:

```tsx
// src/app/service-areas/page.tsx
'use client';

import React from 'react';
import ServiceAreasPage from '../../../service-areas/index.jsx';

export default function ServiceAreas() {
  return <ServiceAreasPage />;
}
```

This component imports the ServiceAreasPage component from the Relume-root directory and renders it.

### 3. Testing

The Service Areas page was tested by:

- Running the development server
- Navigating to `/service-areas` in the browser
- Verifying that the page loads correctly
- Checking for any console errors

Initially, the Service Areas page returned a 404 error due to creating the page in the wrong directory. The issue was fixed by creating the page.tsx file in the correct directory (Relume-root/src/app/service-areas/) instead of the project root's src/app/service-areas/ directory. This highlights the importance of understanding the project's directory structure and working in the primary working directory (Relume-root/).

After fixing the directory structure issue, the page was still malformatted due to two issues:

1. **Invalid CSS Classes**: Several components were using `rb-5` and `rb-12` classes, which are not valid Tailwind CSS classes. These were removed from the following components:

   - Layout245.jsx:
     - Changed `rb-12` to just use the existing `mb-12` class
     - Changed three instances of `rb-5` to just use the existing `mb-5` class
   - Layout10.jsx:
     - Changed `rb-5` to just use the existing `mb-5` class
   - Layout4.jsx:
     - Changed `rb-5` to just use the existing `mb-5` class
   - Layout6.jsx:
     - Changed `rb-5` to just use the existing `mb-5` class

2. **Missing Tailwind Configuration**: The service-areas directory was not included in the Tailwind CSS configuration. This was fixed by updating the tailwind.config.js file to include the service-areas directory in the content array:

   ```javascript
   // tailwind.config.js
   content: [
     // ... existing content
     "./service-areas/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}"
   ]
   ```

These issues are similar to formatting problems encountered in other pages. After these fixes, the page loaded correctly and displayed the expected content.

## Documentation Updates

- Created this daily log for the Service Areas page implementation
- Updated the webpage progress tracker to reflect the completion of the Service Areas page
- Added the Service Areas page to the relevant documentation files

## Next Steps

1. Continue implementing any remaining pages according to the architecture documentation
2. Update the documentation to reflect the current state of the project
3. Test all pages to ensure they work correctly

## Time Tracking

- Service Areas Page Implementation: 1 hour
- Documentation Updates: 30 minutes
- Total: 1.5 hours
