# Bay-Bow Windows Page Implementation

**Date:** May 12, 2025  
**Author:** Augment Agent  
**Task:** Implement the bay-bow windows page

## Overview

This document details the implementation of the bay-bow windows page for the Windows Doors CA website. The bay-bow windows page showcases bay and bow window products, their features, benefits, and design options.

## Implementation Details

The bay-bow windows page was implemented by creating a route file that points to the existing bay-bow page component. The implementation required fixing an issue with the Faq4 component that was using Relume UI components that weren't properly configured.

### Implementation Steps

1. Verified that the bay-bow page directory and components already existed in the Relume-root directory
2. Created a route file at `Relume-root/pages/bay-bow.js` with the following content:
   ```javascript
   export { default } from '../bay-bow';
   ```
3. Tested the page by opening it in the browser at http://localhost:3000/bay-bow
4. Encountered an error with the Faq4 component that was using Accordion components from @relume_io/relume-ui
5. Fixed the Faq4 component by replacing the Accordion components with a custom implementation using React's useState hook
6. Tested the page again and confirmed it was working correctly

### Directory Structure

The bay-bow windows page follows the standard directory structure for product pages:

```
bay-bow/
├── components/
│   ├── Navbar10.jsx
│   ├── Header44.jsx
│   ├── Header36.jsx
│   ├── Layout1.jsx

```

## Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: Relume UI Accordion Component Error

**Error Message**: 
```
Server Error
Error: Element type is invalid: expected a string (for built-in components) or a class/function (for composite components) but got: undefined. You likely forgot to export your component from the file it's defined in, or you might have mixed up default and named imports.
```

**Root Cause**: The Faq4 component was importing Accordion, AccordionContent, AccordionItem, AccordionTrigger, Button, and Card components from @relume_io/relume-ui, but these components weren't properly configured or available in the project.

**Solution**: 
1. Created a custom implementation of the accordion functionality using React's useState hook
2. Replaced the Relume UI components with standard HTML/JSX elements styled with Tailwind CSS
3. Maintained the same visual appearance and functionality as the original component

**Modified Component Code**:
```jsx
"use client";

import React, { useState } from "react";
import { RxPlus } from "react-icons/rx";

export function Faq4() {
  const [openItems, setOpenItems] = useState({});

  const toggleItem = (itemId) => {
    setOpenItems((prev) => ({
      ...prev,
      [itemId]: !prev[itemId],
    }));
  };

  return (
    <section id="relume" className="px-[5%] py-16 md:py-24 lg:py-28">
      <div className="container max-w-lg">
        <div className="rb-12 mb-12 text-center md:mb-18 lg:mb-20">
          <h2 className="rb-5 mb-5 text-5xl font-bold md:mb-6 md:text-7xl lg:text-8xl">
            FAQs
          </h2>
          <p className="md:text-md">
            Discover answers to your questions about Bay & Bow windows and their
            benefits.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div className="grid items-start justify-stretch gap-4">
          {/* FAQ items with custom accordion implementation */}
          {/* ... (accordion items) ... */}
        </div>
        <div className="mx-auto mt-12 max-w-md text-center md:mt-18 lg:mt-20">
          <h4 className="mb-3 text-2xl font-bold md:mb-4 md:text-3xl md:leading-[1.3] lg:text-4xl">
            Still have questions?
          </h4>
          <p className="md:text-md">Our team is here to help you!</p>
          <div className="mt-6 md:mt-8">
            <button className="inline-flex h-12 items-center justify-center rounded-lg bg-gray-800 px-6 text-center font-medium text-white transition-colors hover:bg-gray-900 focus-visible:outline-none focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-ring focus-visible:ring-offset-2 disabled:pointer-events-none disabled:opacity-50">
              Contact
            </button>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </section>
  );
}
```

## Lessons Learned

1. **Relume UI Component Issues**: Components from @relume_io/relume-ui may not be properly configured or available in the project. When encountering errors with these components, consider creating custom implementations using standard React patterns.

2. **Custom Accordion Implementation**: For accordion functionality, a simple implementation using React's useState hook can be used as a replacement for the Relume UI Accordion components.

3. **Component Reuse**: Similar issues might occur with other components that use Relume UI components. The same approach can be used to fix those components.

## Next Steps

1. Update the webpage progress tracker to include the bay-bow windows page
2. Create documentation for the bay-bow windows page
3. Check other pages for similar issues with Relume UI components
4. Continue with implementing the remaining pages from the Relume-DO-NOT-EDIT directory

## Conclusion

The bay-bow windows page has been successfully implemented and is working as expected. The issue with the Faq4 component has been resolved by creating a custom implementation of the accordion functionality. This approach can be used for other components that encounter similar issues with Relume UI components.
