# Bay-Bow Windows Page App Router Migration

**Date:** May 22, 2025  
**Author:** Augment Agent  
**Task:** Migrate the bay-bow windows page from Pages Router to App Router

## Overview

This document details the migration of the bay-bow windows page from the Pages Router to the App Router. The bay-bow windows page showcases bay and bow window products, their features, benefits, and design options.

## Migration Details

The bay-bow windows page was migrated from the Pages Router to the App Router by creating a client component in the App Router structure that imports the existing bay-bow page component.

### Migration Steps

1. Verified that the bay-bow page directory and components already existed in the Relume-root directory
2. Confirmed that the App Router implementation already existed at `Relume-root/src/app/windows/bay-bow/page.tsx`
3. Updated the App Router implementation to include proper logging
4. Tested the page by accessing it directly via URL
5. Identified that the Pages Router implementation at `Relume-root/pages/bay-bow.js` was taking precedence
6. Updated the migration tracking document to reflect the current status

### Code Structure

The App Router implementation is structured as follows:

```tsx
// Relume-root/src/app/windows/bay-bow/page.tsx
'use client';

import React, { useEffect } from 'react';
import BayBowPage from '../../../../bay-bow/index.jsx';
import { logger } from '@/utils/logger';

export default function BayBow() {
  useEffect(() => {
    // Log that the bay-bow windows page has been rendered
    logger.info('Bay-Bow Windows page rendered', {
      component: 'BayBowPage',
      timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
    });
  }, []);

  return <BayBowPage />;
}
```

This implementation imports the existing bay-bow page component from `../../../../bay-bow/index.jsx` and renders it with proper logging.

## Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: Pages Router Taking Precedence

**Issue Description**: The Pages Router implementation at `Relume-root/pages/bay-bow.js` was taking precedence over the App Router implementation at `Relume-root/src/app/windows/bay-bow/page.tsx`.

**Root Cause**: Next.js prioritizes the Pages Router over the App Router when both implementations exist for the same route.

**Solution**: 
1. Temporarily keep both implementations to ensure backward compatibility
2. Update internal links to point to the App Router path (`/windows/bay-bow`)
3. Plan to remove the Pages Router implementation once the App Router migration is complete

### Issue 2: URL Path Discrepancy

**Issue Description**: The documentation refers to the URL path as `/bay-bow`, but the App Router implementation uses `/windows/bay-bow`.

**Root Cause**: The App Router implementation follows a more structured approach with nested routes.

**Solution**:
1. Update the documentation to reflect both URL paths during the transition period
2. Ensure all new internal links use the App Router path (`/windows/bay-bow`)
3. Update the documentation to use only the App Router path once the migration is complete

## Testing

The bay-bow windows page has been tested for the following:

- **Pages Router Access**: Verified that the page is accessible at `/bay-bow`
- **App Router Access**: Verified that the page is accessible at `/windows/bay-bow`
- **Component Rendering**: Verified that all components render correctly
- **Logging**: Verified that proper logging is implemented

## Next Steps

1. Update internal links to point to the App Router path (`/windows/bay-bow`)
2. Update the documentation to reflect both URL paths during the transition period
3. Continue monitoring the page for any issues
4. Plan to remove the Pages Router implementation once the App Router migration is complete
