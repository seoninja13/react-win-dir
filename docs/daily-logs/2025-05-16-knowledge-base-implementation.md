## Overview

Today we focused on implementing the Knowledge Base system, which is now the project's top priority. We created a comprehensive solution for retrieving content from various sources (including Brave search), semantically chunking it, generating embeddings using Gemini 2.0 Flash, and storing everything in the Supabase vector database.

## Tasks Completed

- [x] Created the `knowledge-base-ingestion.mjs` script for automated content ingestion
- [x] Implemented semantic chunking that preserves paragraph and sentence boundaries
- [x] Set up embedding generation using Gemini 2.0 Flash
- [x] Configured vector storage in Supabase using pgvector
- [x] Created comprehensive documentation for the Knowledge Base system
- [x] Updated project priorities to reflect Knowledge Base as the current priority
- [x] Integrated Knowledge Base documentation into the IDE instructions

## Implementation Details

### Automated Knowledge Base Ingestion

We implemented a comprehensive script (`knowledge-base-ingestion.mjs`) that handles the entire workflow of retrieving content, chunking it, generating embeddings, and storing everything in Supabase. The script supports multiple content sources:

```bash
# Ingest from Brave search
node scripts/knowledge-base-ingestion.mjs --source brave --query "windows installation guide"

# Ingest from a URL
node scripts/knowledge-base-ingestion.mjs --source url --url "https://example.com/docs"

# Ingest from a local file
node scripts/knowledge-base-ingestion.mjs --source file --path "./docs/guide.md"
```

### Semantic Chunking

We implemented a hierarchical semantic chunking approach that:
1. Splits content by paragraphs first
2. Handles large paragraphs by splitting into sentences
3. Handles large sentences by splitting into words
4. Adds overlaps between chunks to maintain context

This approach ensures that chunks maintain semantic coherence and context, which is critical for effective retrieval.

### Embedding Generation

We configured the embedding generation process to use Gemini 2.0 Flash, which provides high-quality embeddings for semantic search. The process includes:
- Rate limiting to avoid API throttling
- Batch processing for efficiency
- Error handling for robustness

### Vector Storage

We set up Supabase with pgvector to store and query vector embeddings efficiently. Each document in the knowledge base includes:
- The original content chunk
- The generated embedding vector
- Comprehensive metadata for filtering and context

## Documentation Updates

We created a comprehensive set of documentation for the Knowledge Base system:

1. **Knowledge Base Overview** - Main entry point for knowledge base documentation
2. **Knowledge Base Workflow** - Complete end-to-end workflow of the knowledge base system
3. **Semantic Chunking Process** - Detailed explanation of the semantic chunking process
4. **Embedding Generation** - How embeddings are generated using Gemini 2.0 Flash
5. **Vector Storage** - How vectors are stored and retrieved from Supabase
6. **Search Functionality** - How the search functionality works
7. **Automated Ingestion Process** - How to automatically ingest content from various sources

We also updated the project's priority tracking to reflect that the Knowledge Base System Implementation is now the current priority, with Website Performance Optimization planned as the next priority.

## Next Steps

1. **Integration with Website**
   - Integrate the knowledge base search functionality with the website
   - Create a search interface for users to query the knowledge base

2. **Testing**
   - Test the knowledge base with various content types
   - Optimize chunk size and overlap based on retrieval performance

3. **Performance Monitoring**
   - Set up monitoring for API usage and costs
   - Implement caching for frequently accessed content

## Issues and Resolutions

### Issue: Markdown Linting Errors

**Issue**: We encountered markdown linting errors in the documentation, particularly with duplicate headings.

**Resolution**: We updated the headings to be more specific and unique, resolving the linting errors.

### Issue: Path References in Documentation

**Issue**: Some path references in the documentation were incorrect or inconsistent.

**Resolution**: We standardized all path references to use relative paths from the document's location, ensuring consistency across the documentation.
