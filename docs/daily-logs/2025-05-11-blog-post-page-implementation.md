# Daily Log: May 11, 2025 - Blog Post Page Implementation

## Summary

Today's focus was on implementing and testing the Blog Post page for the Windows Doors CA website. The Blog Post page is a blog single post page template (T6 template) that provides a detailed view of an individual blog post with content, author information, and related posts.

## Tasks Completed

### 1. Blog Post Page Implementation

- Created a new blog-post directory in the Relume-root folder
- Created components for the Blog Post page
- Created a route for the Blog Post page at `/blog/post` path
- Tested the Blog Post page to ensure it renders correctly

### 2. Documentation Updates

- Updated the Webpage Progress Tracker to reflect the completion of the Blog Post page
- Updated the T6 template status to "Complete"
- Created this daily log entry to document the implementation process

## Implementation Details

### Directory and Component Creation

Since there was no existing Blog Post template in the Relume-DO-NOT-EDIT folder, we created the necessary components from scratch:

1. Created a new blog-post directory in the Relume-root folder
2. Created a components subdirectory for the Blog Post page components
3. Created the following components:
   - Header46 - Header component with blog post title, date, author, and featured image
   - BlogPost1 - Main content component with the blog post text
   - Cta13 - Call to action component

### Route Creation

Created a route for the Blog Post page by adding a new file at `Relume-root/pages/blog/post.js` that exports the Blog Post component:

```javascript
export { default } from '../../blog-post';
```

### Component Structure

The Blog Post page consists of the following components:

1. Navbar10 - Navigation bar component (reused from the Blog page)
2. Header46 - Header component with blog post title, date, author, and featured image
3. BlogPost1 - Main content component with the blog post text
4. Cta13 - Call to action component
5. Footer4 - Footer component (reused from the Blog page)

### Testing

After implementing the components and route, we tested the Blog Post page by:

1. Opening the page in the browser at http://localhost:3002/blog/post
2. Checking the console for any errors
3. Verifying that the page renders correctly with all components

## Issues Encountered

We encountered an issue with the imports in the Blog Post page. The initial implementation was trying to import components from a non-existent "../components" directory. We fixed this by updating the imports to use the components from the Blog page:

```javascript
import { Navbar10 } from "../blog/components/Navbar10";
import { Footer4 } from "../blog/components/Footer4";
```

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Testing**: Continue testing the Blog Post page to ensure all components render correctly and all functionality works as expected.

2. **Implement Internal Links**: Implement and test all internal links on the Blog Post page.

3. **Rail Room Integration**: Complete the integration with Rail Room for the Blog Post page.

4. **Dynamic Content**: Implement dynamic content loading for blog posts from the database.

5. **Documentation**: Create detailed documentation for the Blog Post page, including component structure, content, and functionality.

- Blog Post Page Implementation: 2 hours
- Documentation Updates: 1 hour
- Total: 3 hours
