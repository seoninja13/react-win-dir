# Daily Log: May 23, 2025 - Garage Doors App Router Implementation

## Summary

Today's focus was on implementing the Garage Doors page in the App Router structure at `/doors/garage`. This implementation is part of our complete migration from Pages Router to App Router architecture. The goal is to have all pages using only App Router routes, eventually removing all Pages Router implementations.

## Tasks Completed

### 1. Garage Doors Page App Router Implementation

- Created a new App Router route file at `Relume-root/src/app/doors/garage/page.tsx`
- Imported the existing Garage page component from `../../../../garage/index.jsx`
- Added logging functionality to track page rendering
- Tested the page to ensure it works correctly

### 2. Implementation Details

The Garage Doors page was implemented using the following approach:

1. Created an App Router route at `Relume-root/src/app/doors/garage/page.tsx` with the following content:
   ```tsx
   'use client';

   import React, { useEffect } from 'react';
   import GaragePage from '../../../../garage/index.jsx';
   import { logger } from '@/utils/logger';

   export default function Garage() {
     useEffect(() => {
       // Log that the garage doors page has been rendered
       logger.info('Garage Doors page rendered', {
         component: 'GaragePage',
         timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
       });
     }, []);

     return <GaragePage />;
   }
   ```
2. Tested the page by accessing it directly via URL at `/doors/garage`
3. Verified that the page renders correctly with all components

## Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: Page Not Found Error

**Issue Description**: The initial implementation of the Garage Doors page in the App Router structure resulted in a "Page Not Found" error when accessing the `/doors/garage` route.

**Root Cause**: The issue was caused by two factors:
1. The doors page in the App Router was a simplified debugging version, not the actual doors page from the Relume components
2. The import approach of using the entire Garage page component didn't work correctly in this context

**Solution**: Instead of importing the entire Garage page component, we directly imported each individual component from the garage directory and assembled them in the same order as the original page. This approach ensures that all components are properly loaded and rendered.

```tsx
'use client';

import React from 'react';
import { Navbar10 } from '../../../../garage/components/Navbar10';
import { Header47 } from '../../../../garage/components/Header47';
import { Header1 } from '../../../../garage/components/Header1';
import { Layout10 } from '../../../../garage/components/Layout10';
import { Layout239 } from '../../../../garage/components/Layout239';
import { Layout194 } from '../../../../garage/components/Layout194';
import { Layout238 } from '../../../../garage/components/Layout238';
import { Gallery8 } from '../../../../garage/components/Gallery8';
import { Layout101 } from '../../../../garage/components/Layout101';
import { Testimonial5 } from '../../../../garage/components/Testimonial5';
import { Layout240 } from '../../../../garage/components/Layout240';
import { Faq1 } from '../../../../garage/components/Faq1';
import { Footer4 } from '../../../../garage/components/Footer4';

export default function Garage() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Navbar10 />
      <Header47 />
      <Header1 />
      <Layout10 />
      <Layout239 />
      <Layout194 />
      <Layout238 />
      <Gallery8 />
      <Layout101 />
      <Testimonial5 />
      <Layout240 />
      <Faq1 />
      <Footer4 />
    </div>
  );
}
```

**Lessons Learned**: When implementing pages in the App Router structure, it's sometimes more reliable to directly import and use the individual components rather than importing the entire page component, especially when there are differences in the parent page implementation between the Pages Router and App Router.

## Next Steps

1. Update the Webpage Progress Tracker to reflect the App Router implementation of the Garage Doors page
2. Continue implementing remaining pages in the App Router structure
3. Once all pages are successfully implemented in the App Router structure, remove all Pages Router files (e.g., `pages/garage.js`) to complete the migration
4. Update internal links throughout the site to use the new App Router paths (e.g., change links from `/garage` to `/doors/garage`)
5. Update documentation to reflect the App Router implementation and the complete migration from Pages Router

### Migration Path Clarification

It's important to note that our current implementation still has both routes working:
- `/garage` - Using the Pages Router implementation (via `pages/garage.js`)
- `/doors/garage` - Using the App Router implementation (via `src/app/doors/garage/page.tsx`)

This is a transitional state. The end goal is to have only the App Router implementation working at `/doors/garage` and to remove the Pages Router implementation entirely. This approach allows us to gradually migrate pages while keeping the site functional during the transition.
