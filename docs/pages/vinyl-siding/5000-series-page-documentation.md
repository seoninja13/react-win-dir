## Implementation Details

### Route Configuration

The 5000-Series page is configured with the following routes:

1. **Pages Router Route**:
   ```javascript
   // Relume-root/pages/5000-series.js
   export { default } from '../5000-series';
   ```

2. **App Router Route**:
   ```typescript
   // src/app/vinyl-siding/5000-series/page.tsx
   'use client';

   import React from 'react';
   import Series5000Page from '../../../../5000-series/index.jsx';

   export default function Series5000() {
     return <Series5000Page />;
   }
   ```

### Main Component

The main 5000-Series component is defined in `Relume-root/5000-series/index.jsx`:

```jsx
import React from "react";
import { Navbar10 } from "./components/Navbar10";
import { Header44 } from "./components/Header44";
import { Header15 } from "./components/Header15";
import { Layout16 } from "./components/Layout16";
import { Layout6 } from "./components/Layout6";
import { Layout10 } from "./components/Layout10";
import { Gallery2 } from "./components/Gallery2";
import { Layout24 } from "./components/Layout24";
import { Testimonial5 } from "./components/Testimonial5";
import { Layout3 } from "./components/Layout3";
import { Faq5 } from "./components/Faq5";
import { Footer4 } from "./components/Footer4";

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Navbar10 />
      <Header44 />
      <Header15 />
      <Layout16 />
      <Layout6 />
      <Layout10 />
      <Gallery2 />
      <Layout24 />
      <Testimonial5 />
      <Layout3 />
      <Faq5 />
      <Footer4 />
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Issues and Solutions

During the implementation of the 5000-Series page, the following issues were encountered:

### 1. Navbar and Header Styling Issues

**Issue**: The navbar and header components on the 5000-series page are displaying with incorrect styling and layout, while other pages like double-hung and picture-window are working correctly.

**Symptoms**:
- The navbar appears with incorrect spacing, alignment, and possibly font styling
- The header section has layout issues, possibly with incorrect padding, margins, or background
- These issues only occur on the 5000-series page, not on other pages

**Status**: Unresolved. The page is functional but has visual presentation issues.

**Troubleshooting Steps**:
1. Compared the Navbar10 and Header44 components in the 5000-series directory with the same components in working pages
2. Verified that all necessary CSS classes are present and correctly applied
3. Checked for any custom styling that might be overriding the expected styles
4. Examined the component hierarchy to ensure proper nesting and structure

**Potential Solutions**:
1. Perform a detailed comparison of the CSS classes between working and non-working components
2. Check for any CSS specificity issues that might be causing style overrides
3. Consider recreating the problematic components based on the working versions from other pages
4. Test with browser developer tools to identify specific CSS rules causing the issues

### 2. Accordion Component Import Error

**Issue**: The Faq5.jsx component was missing the necessary imports for the Accordion components from @relume_io/relume-ui.

**Error Message**: The page would not load properly because the Faq5.jsx component was using a different structure than the other series' Faq5.jsx components.

**Solution**: Modified the Faq5.jsx component to import the necessary components and update the component structure:

```jsx
// Before
import { Button } from "@relume_io/relume-ui";
import React from "react";
import { RxPlus } from "react-icons/rx";

// After
import {
  Accordion,
  AccordionContent,
  AccordionItem,
  AccordionTrigger,
  Button,
} from "@relume_io/relume-ui";
import React from "react";
import { RxPlus } from "react-icons/rx";
```

### 2. Connection Refused Error

**Issue**: When trying to access the page at http://localhost:3000/vinyl-siding/5000-series, the connection was refused.

**Error Message**: "This site can't be reached. localhost refused to connect."

**Solution**: The issue was related to the development server not starting properly. The solution was to:
1. Kill all Node.js processes using `taskkill /F /FI "IMAGENAME eq node.exe"`
2. Start the development server using `yarn dev` from the project root directory

## Testing

The 5000-Series page has been tested for the following:

1. **Visual Consistency**: **FAILED** - The navbar and header components do not visually match the design of other series pages
2. **Responsive Design**: Partially tested, but visual issues make complete testing difficult
3. **Navigation**: Verified that all navigation links work correctly despite styling issues
4. **Accordion Functionality**: Verified that the FAQ accordion expands and collapses correctly after fixing the import issues
5. **Button Functionality**: Verified that all buttons have the correct functionality, though styling may be affected

### Testing Status

| Test | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Visual Consistency | Failed | Navbar and header styling issues |
| Responsive Design | Incomplete | Cannot fully test due to styling issues |
| Navigation | Passed | Links work correctly |
| Accordion Functionality | Passed | Works after fixing import issues |
| Button Functionality | Passed | Functionality works, styling may be affected |
| Cross-browser Testing | Not Started | Pending resolution of styling issues |
| Accessibility Testing | Not Started | Pending resolution of styling issues |
