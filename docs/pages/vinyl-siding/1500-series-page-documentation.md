## Implementation Details

The 1500-Series page was implemented using the following approach:

1. Created the directory structure for the 1500-series page
2. Created the index.jsx file with imports for all components
3. Created each component with content specific to the 1500-Series vinyl siding
4. Created the route for the 1500-series page
5. Tested the page to ensure all components are rendering correctly

### Code Structure

The 1500-Series page is structured as follows:

```
1500-series/
├── components/
│   ├── Navbar10.jsx
│   ├── Header54.jsx
│   ├── Header71.jsx
│   ├── Layout4.jsx
│   ├── Layout6.jsx
│   ├── Layout10.jsx
│   ├── Gallery2.jsx
│   ├── Layout24.jsx
│   ├── Testimonial5.jsx
│   ├── Layout3.jsx
│   ├── Faq5.jsx
│   └── Footer4.jsx
└── index.jsx
```

The `index.jsx` file imports all components and renders them in the correct order.

## Issues and Solutions

During the implementation of the 1500-Series page, the following issues were encountered and resolved:

### 1. Card Component Error

**Issue**: The Faq6.jsx component in the Relume-root/1500-series/components directory was importing a Card component from @relume_io/relume-ui, but this component doesn't exist in the library.

**Error Message**: 
```
Error: Element type is invalid: expected a string (for built-in components) or a class/function (for composite components) but got: undefined. You likely forgot to export your component from the file it's defined in, or you might have mixed up default and named imports.
```

**Solution**: Modified the Faq6.jsx file to replace the Card component with a div element with appropriate styling (border, rounded-md, shadow-sm classes).

**Code Change**:
```jsx
// Before
import {
  Accordion,
  AccordionContent,
  AccordionItem,
  AccordionTrigger,
  Button,
  Card,
} from "@relume_io/relume-ui";

// After
import {
  Accordion,
  AccordionContent,
  AccordionItem,
  AccordionTrigger,
  Button,
} from "@relume_io/relume-ui";

// Before
<Card>
  <AccordionItem value="item-0" className="border-none px-5 md:px-6">
    ...
  </AccordionItem>
</Card>

// After
<div className="border rounded-md shadow-sm">
  <AccordionItem value="item-0" className="border-none px-5 md:px-6">
    ...
  </AccordionItem>
</div>
```

### 2. JSX Closing Tag Error

**Issue**: After replacing Card with div, the closing tags were still </Card> instead of </div>.

**Error Message**: 
```
Error: Expected corresponding JSX closing tag for <div>
```

**Solution**: Updated all closing tags from </Card> to </div> to match the opening tags.

**Code Change**:
```jsx
// Before
<div className="border rounded-md shadow-sm">
  <AccordionItem value="item-0" className="border-none px-5 md:px-6">
    ...
  </AccordionItem>
</Card>

// After
<div className="border rounded-md shadow-sm">
  <AccordionItem value="item-0" className="border-none px-5 md:px-6">
    ...
  </AccordionItem>
</div>
```
