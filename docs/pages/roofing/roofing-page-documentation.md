## Route Configuration

The Roofing page is configured with the following route:

```javascript
// File: Relume-root/pages/roofing.js
export { default } from '../roofing';
```

This configuration ensures that the `/roofing` URL path renders the Roofing component.

## Implementation Details

### Main Component

The main Roofing component is defined in `Relume-root/roofing/index.jsx`:

```jsx
import { Faq3 } from "./components/Faq3";
import { Footer4 } from "./components/Footer4";
import { Gallery1 } from "./components/Gallery1";
import { Header26 } from "./components/Header26";
import { Header47 } from "./components/Header47";
import { Layout10 } from "./components/Layout10";
import { Layout242 } from "./components/Layout242";
import { Layout249 } from "./components/Layout249";
import { Layout3 } from "./components/Layout3";
import { Layout3_1 } from "./components/Layout3_1";
import { Layout4 } from "./components/Layout4";
import { Navbar10 } from "./components/Navbar10";

export default function Roofing() {
  return (
    <>
      <Navbar10 />
      <Header47 />
      <Header26 />
      <Layout3 />
      <Layout242 />
      <Layout3_1 />
      <Layout249 />
      <Gallery1 />
      <Layout10 />
      <Layout4 />
      <Faq3 />
      <Footer4 />
    </>
  );
}
```

### Component Integration

All components are imported from their respective files in the `components` directory and rendered in sequence to create the complete Roofing page.

## Testing

The Roofing page has been tested for:

1. **Rendering**: Verified that all components render correctly
2. **Navigation**: Tested that the page is accessible via the `/roofing` URL
3. **Responsiveness**: Checked that the page displays correctly on different screen sizes
4. **Component Functionality**: Ensured that all interactive elements work as expected

## Issues and Resolutions

No significant issues were encountered during the implementation of the Roofing page. Unlike the Windows and Installation pages, the Roofing page did not have any Card component issues that needed to be fixed.
