## Implementation Details

The Entry Doors page was implemented using the following approach:

1. Verified that the entry page directory and components already existed in the Relume-root directory
2. Created a route file at `Relume-root/pages/entry.js` with the following content:
   ```javascript
   export { default } from '../entry';
   ```
3. Tested the page by opening it in the browser at http://localhost:3000/entry
4. Confirmed that the page rendered correctly with all components

### Code Structure

The Entry Doors page is structured as follows:

```
entry/
├── components/
│   ├── Navbar10.jsx
│   ├── Header54.jsx
│   ├── Header15.jsx
│   ├── Layout1.jsx
│   ├── Layout245.jsx
│   ├── Layout238.jsx
│   ├── Gallery10.jsx
│   ├── Layout240.jsx
│   ├── Testimonial1.jsx
│   ├── Layout238_1.jsx
│   ├── Faq1.jsx
│   └── Footer4.jsx
└── index.jsx
```

The `index.jsx` file imports all components and renders them in the correct order:

```jsx
import React from "react";
import { Navbar10 } from "./components/Navbar10";
import { Header54 } from "./components/Header54";
import { Header15 } from "./components/Header15";
import { Layout1 } from "./components/Layout1";
import { Layout245 } from "./components/Layout245";
import { Layout238 } from "./components/Layout238";
import { Gallery10 } from "./components/Gallery10";
import { Layout240 } from "./components/Layout240";
import { Testimonial1 } from "./components/Testimonial1";
import { Layout238_1 } from "./components/Layout238_1";
import { Faq1 } from "./components/Faq1";
import { Footer4 } from "./components/Footer4";

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Navbar10 />
      <Header54 />
      <Header15 />
      <Layout1 />
      <Layout245 />
      <Layout238 />
      <Gallery10 />
      <Layout240 />
      <Testimonial1 />
      <Layout238_1 />
      <Faq1 />
      <Footer4 />
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Issues and Solutions

No issues were encountered during the implementation of the Entry Doors page. The implementation was straightforward because:

1. The entry page directory and components already existed in the Relume-root directory
2. We followed the established pattern for creating route files
3. We verified that the page exists in the Relume-DO-NOT-EDIT directory before implementing it

## Testing

The Entry Doors page has been tested for the following:

- **Desktop Rendering**: Verified that all components render correctly on desktop
- **Mobile Rendering**: Verified that all components render correctly on mobile
- **Tablet Rendering**: Verified that all components render correctly on tablet
- **Component Functionality**: Verified that all interactive components function correctly
- **Navigation**: Verified that all navigation links work correctly
- **Call-to-Action Buttons**: Verified that all call-to-action buttons work correctly
