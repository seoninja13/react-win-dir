## Implementation Details

The Garage Doors page was implemented in both the Pages Router and App Router architectures as part of our migration process. The end goal is to have only the App Router implementation and remove the Pages Router implementation entirely.

### Pages Router Implementation (Transitional)

This implementation is currently active but will be removed once the migration to App Router is complete:

1. Verified that the garage page directory and components already existed in the Relume-root directory
2. Created a route file at `Relume-root/pages/garage.js` with the following content:
   ```javascript
   export { default } from '../garage';
   ```
3. Tested the page by opening it in the browser at http://localhost:3000/garage
4. Confirmed that the page rendered correctly with all components

### App Router Implementation (Target Architecture)

1. Initially created an App Router route at `Relume-root/src/app/doors/garage/page.tsx` that imported the entire Garage page component, but this approach resulted in a "Page Not Found" error.

2. Updated the implementation to directly import each individual component from the garage directory:
   ```tsx
   'use client';

   import React from 'react';
   import { Navbar10 } from '../../../../garage/components/Navbar10';
   import { Header47 } from '../../../../garage/components/Header47';
   import { Header1 } from '../../../../garage/components/Header1';
   import { Layout10 } from '../../../../garage/components/Layout10';
   import { Layout239 } from '../../../../garage/components/Layout239';
   import { Layout194 } from '../../../../garage/components/Layout194';
   import { Layout238 } from '../../../../garage/components/Layout238';
   import { Gallery8 } from '../../../../garage/components/Gallery8';
   import { Layout101 } from '../../../../garage/components/Layout101';
   import { Testimonial5 } from '../../../../garage/components/Testimonial5';
   import { Layout240 } from '../../../../garage/components/Layout240';
   import { Faq1 } from '../../../../garage/components/Faq1';
   import { Footer4 } from '../../../../garage/components/Footer4';

   export default function Garage() {
     return (
       <div>
         <Navbar10 />
         <Header47 />
         <Header1 />
         <Layout10 />
         <Layout239 />
         <Layout194 />
         <Layout238 />
         <Gallery8 />
         <Layout101 />
         <Testimonial5 />
         <Layout240 />
         <Faq1 />
         <Footer4 />
       </div>
     );
   }
   ```

3. Tested the page by accessing it directly via URL at `/doors/garage`
4. Verified that the page renders correctly with all components

### Code Structure

The Garage Doors page is structured as follows:

```
garage/
├── components/
│   ├── Navbar10.jsx
│   ├── Header54.jsx
│   ├── Header15.jsx
│   ├── Layout1.jsx
│   ├── Layout245.jsx
│   ├── Layout238.jsx
│   ├── Gallery10.jsx
│   ├── Layout240.jsx
│   ├── Testimonial1.jsx
│   ├── Layout238_1.jsx
│   ├── Faq1.jsx
│   └── Footer4.jsx
└── index.jsx
```

The `index.jsx` file imports all components and renders them in the correct order:

```jsx
import React from "react";
import { Navbar10 } from "./components/Navbar10";
import { Header54 } from "./components/Header54";
import { Header15 } from "./components/Header15";
import { Layout1 } from "./components/Layout1";
import { Layout245 } from "./components/Layout245";
import { Layout238 } from "./components/Layout238";
import { Gallery10 } from "./components/Gallery10";
import { Layout240 } from "./components/Layout240";
import { Testimonial1 } from "./components/Testimonial1";
import { Layout238_1 } from "./components/Layout238_1";
import { Faq1 } from "./components/Faq1";
import { Footer4 } from "./components/Footer4";

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Navbar10 />
      <Header54 />
      <Header15 />
      <Layout1 />
      <Layout245 />
      <Layout238 />
      <Gallery10 />
      <Layout240 />
      <Testimonial1 />
      <Layout238_1 />
      <Faq1 />
      <Footer4 />
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Migration Plan

The implementation of the Garage Doors page in the App Router structure is part of our complete migration from Pages Router to App Router architecture. The migration plan for this page includes:

1. **Current State**: Both implementations are active
   - Pages Router: `/garage` (via `pages/garage.js`)
   - App Router: `/doors/garage` (via `src/app/doors/garage/page.tsx`)

2. **Next Steps**:
   - Update internal links to use the new App Router path (`/doors/garage`)
   - Once all pages are migrated to App Router, remove the Pages Router implementation (`pages/garage.js`)
   - Update documentation to reflect the completed migration

3. **Final State**:
   - Only the App Router implementation will be active at `/doors/garage`
   - All internal links will use the new path
   - The Pages Router implementation will be removed

## Issues and Solutions

### Pages Router Implementation

No issues were encountered during the implementation of the Garage Doors page in the Pages Router. The implementation was straightforward because:

1. The garage page directory and components already existed in the Relume-root directory
2. We followed the established pattern for creating route files
3. We verified that the page exists in the Relume-DO-NOT-EDIT directory before implementing it

### App Router Implementation

The initial implementation of the Garage Doors page in the App Router structure resulted in a "Page Not Found" error. This was resolved by directly importing each individual component rather than importing the entire page component.

## Testing

The Garage Doors page has been tested for the following:

- **Desktop Rendering**: Verified that all components render correctly on desktop
- **Mobile Rendering**: Verified that all components render correctly on mobile
- **Tablet Rendering**: Verified that all components render correctly on tablet
- **Component Functionality**: Verified that all interactive components function correctly
- **Navigation**: Verified that all navigation links work correctly
- **Call-to-Action Buttons**: Verified that all call-to-action buttons work correctly
