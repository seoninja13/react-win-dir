## Route Configuration

The Financing page is configured with the following route:

```javascript
// File: Relume-root/pages/financing.js
export { default } from '../financing';
```

This configuration ensures that the `/financing` URL path renders the Financing component.

## Implementation Details

### Main Component

The main Financing component is defined in `Relume-root/financing/index.jsx`:

```jsx
import { Content27 } from "./components/Content27";
import { Faq5 } from "./components/Faq5";
import { Footer4 } from "./components/Footer4";
import { Header1 } from "./components/Header1";
import { Header46 } from "./components/Header46";
import { Layout1 } from "./components/Layout1";
import { Layout18 } from "./components/Layout18";
import { Layout239 } from "./components/Layout239";
import { Layout6 } from "./components/Layout6";
import { Layout90 } from "./components/Layout90";
import { Navbar10 } from "./components/Navbar10";

export default function Financing() {
  return (
    <>
      <Navbar10 />
      <Header46 />
      <Header1 />
      <Layout6 />
      <Layout90 />
      <Layout239 />
      <Layout18 />
      <Layout1 />
      <Faq5 />
      <Content27 />
      <Footer4 />
    </>
  );
}
```

### Component Integration

All components are imported from their respective files in the `components` directory and rendered in sequence to create the complete Financing page.

### Card Component Issue

We encountered an issue with the Card component in the Faq5.jsx file. The Card component was properly imported from the Relume UI library, but there was an issue with the component rendering. We fixed the issue by replacing the Card component with a standard div element with similar styling (border, rounded corners, and shadow). This approach avoids any potential issues with the Card component from the Relume UI library.

The modified Faq5.jsx file:

```jsx
"use client";

import {
  Accordion,
  AccordionContent,
  AccordionItem,
  AccordionTrigger,
  Button,
} from "@relume_io/relume-ui";
import React from "react";
import { RxPlus } from "react-icons/rx";

export function Faq5() {
  return (
    <section id="relume" className="px-[5%] py-16 md:py-24 lg:py-28">
      <div className="container">
        <div className="rb-12 mb-12 max-w-lg md:mb-18 lg:mb-20">
          <h2 className="rb-5 mb-5 text-5xl font-bold md:mb-6 md:text-7xl lg:text-8xl">
            FAQs
          </h2>
          <p className="md:text-md">
            Find answers to your questions about our financing options and how
            they can benefit you.
          </p>
        </div>
        <Accordion
          type="multiple"
          className="grid items-start justify-stretch gap-4"
        >
          <div className="border rounded-lg shadow-sm">
            <AccordionItem value="item-0" className="border-none px-5 md:px-6">
              <AccordionTrigger
                icon={
                  <RxPlus className="size-7 shrink-0 text-text-primary transition-transform duration-300 md:size-8" />
                }
                className="md:py-5 md:text-md [&[data-state=open]>svg]:rotate-45"
              >
                What is financing?
              </AccordionTrigger>
              <AccordionContent className="md:pb-6">

              </AccordionContent>
            </AccordionItem>
          </div>
          <!-- Additional accordion items -->
        </Accordion>
        <div className="mt-12 md:mt-18 lg:mt-20">
          <h4 className="mb-3 text-2xl font-bold md:mb-4 md:text-3xl md:leading-[1.3] lg:text-4xl">

          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </section>
  );
}
```

## Testing

The Financing page has been tested for:

1. **Rendering**: Verified that all components render correctly
2. **Navigation**: Tested that the page is accessible via the `/financing` URL
3. **Responsiveness**: Checked that the page displays correctly on different screen sizes
4. **Component Functionality**: Ensured that all interactive elements work as expected
