## Implementation Details

The Bay-Bow Windows page was implemented using the following approach:

1. Verified that the bay-bow page directory and components already existed in the Relume-root directory
2. Created a route file at `Relume-root/pages/bay-bow.js` with the following content:
   ```javascript
   export { default } from '../bay-bow';
   ```
3. Encountered an error with the Faq4 component that was using Accordion components from @relume_io/relume-ui
4. Fixed the Faq4 component by replacing the Accordion components with a custom implementation using React's useState hook
5. Tested the page and confirmed it was working correctly

### Code Structure

The Bay-Bow Windows page is structured as follows:

```
bay-bow/
├── components/
│   ├── Navbar10.jsx
│   ├── Header44.jsx
│   ├── Header36.jsx
│   ├── Layout1.jsx
│   ├── Layout242.jsx
│   ├── Layout6.jsx
│   ├── Layout241.jsx
│   ├── Layout1_1.jsx
│   ├── Layout240.jsx
│   ├── Gallery1.jsx
│   ├── Layout90.jsx
│   ├── Faq4.jsx (modified)
│   └── Footer4.jsx
└── index.jsx
```

The `index.jsx` file imports all components and renders them in the correct order:

```jsx
import React from "react";
import { Navbar10 } from "./components/Navbar10";
import { Header44 } from "./components/Header44";
import { Header36 } from "./components/Header36";
import { Layout1 } from "./components/Layout1";
import { Layout242 } from "./components/Layout242";
import { Layout6 } from "./components/Layout6";
import { Layout241 } from "./components/Layout241";
import { Layout1_1 } from "./components/Layout1_1";
import { Layout240 } from "./components/Layout240";
import { Gallery1 } from "./components/Gallery1";
import { Layout90 } from "./components/Layout90";
import { Faq4 } from "./components/Faq4";
import { Footer4 } from "./components/Footer4";

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Navbar10 />
      <Header44 />
      <Header36 />
      <Layout1 />
      <Layout242 />
      <Layout6 />
      <Layout241 />
      <Layout1_1 />
      <Layout240 />
      <Gallery1 />
      <Layout90 />
      <Faq4 />
      <Footer4 />
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: Relume UI Accordion Component Error

**Error Message**: 
```
Server Error
Error: Element type is invalid: expected a string (for built-in components) or a class/function (for composite components) but got: undefined. You likely forgot to export your component from the file it's defined in, or you might have mixed up default and named imports.
```

**Root Cause**: The Faq4 component was importing Accordion, AccordionContent, AccordionItem, AccordionTrigger, Button, and Card components from @relume_io/relume-ui, but these components weren't properly configured or available in the project.

**Solution**: 
1. Created a custom implementation of the accordion functionality using React's useState hook
2. Replaced the Relume UI components with standard HTML/JSX elements styled with Tailwind CSS
3. Maintained the same visual appearance and functionality as the original component

The modified Faq4 component uses a simple state management approach to toggle the visibility of each FAQ item:

```jsx
const [openItems, setOpenItems] = useState({});

const toggleItem = (itemId) => {
  setOpenItems((prev) => ({
    ...prev,
    [itemId]: !prev[itemId],
  }));
};
```

Each FAQ item is rendered as a div with a button that toggles the visibility of the answer:

```jsx
<div className="rounded-lg border border-gray-200 bg-white shadow-sm">
  <div className="border-none px-5 md:px-6">
    <button
      className="flex w-full items-center justify-between py-4 text-left font-medium md:py-5 md:text-md"
      onClick={() => toggleItem("item-0")}
    >
      <span>What are Bay windows?</span>
      <RxPlus
        className={`size-7 shrink-0 text-text-primary transition-transform duration-300 md:size-8 ${
          openItems["item-0"] ? "rotate-45" : ""
        }`}
      />
    </button>
    {openItems["item-0"] && (
      <div className="pb-4 md:pb-6">
        Bay windows are a combination of three or more windows that
        project outward from your home. They create a beautiful nook and
        enhance the curb appeal. This design allows for more natural
        light and a wider view of your surroundings.
      </div>
    )}
  </div>
</div>
```
