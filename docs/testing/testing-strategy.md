# Testing Strategy

This document outlines the testing strategy for the Window World LA website.

## Overview

The testing strategy for the Window World LA website is designed to ensure the quality, reliability, and performance of the website. It includes various types of testing, tools, and processes to identify and fix issues before they reach production.

## Testing Types

### 1. Unit Testing

Unit testing focuses on testing individual components and functions in isolation.

#### Tools

- **Jest**: JavaScript testing framework
- **React Testing Library**: Testing utilities for React components

#### What to Test

- **Components**: Test that components render correctly and respond to user interactions
- **Utility Functions**: Test that utility functions return the expected results
- **Hooks**: Test that custom hooks behave as expected

#### Example

```jsx
// src/components/Button.test.jsx
import { render, screen, fireEvent } from '@testing-library/react';
import Button from './Button';

describe('Button', () => {
  it('renders correctly', () => {
    render(<Button>Click me</Button>);
    expect(screen.getByText('Click me')).toBeInTheDocument();
  });

  it('calls onClick when clicked', () => {
    const handleClick = jest.fn();
    render(<Button onClick={handleClick}>Click me</Button>);
    fireEvent.click(screen.getByText('Click me'));
    expect(handleClick).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1);
  });
});
```

### 2. Integration Testing

Integration testing focuses on testing how components and functions work together.

#### Tools

- **Jest**: JavaScript testing framework
- **React Testing Library**: Testing utilities for React components
- **MSW (Mock Service Worker)**: API mocking library

#### What to Test

- **Component Interactions**: Test that components interact correctly with each other
- **API Interactions**: Test that components interact correctly with APIs
- **Form Submissions**: Test that forms submit correctly and handle errors

#### Example

```jsx
// src/pages/Contact.test.jsx
import { render, screen, fireEvent, waitFor } from '@testing-library/react';
import { rest } from 'msw';
import { setupServer } from 'msw/node';
import ContactPage from './ContactPage';

const server = setupServer(
  rest.post('/api/contact', (req, res, ctx) => {
    return res(ctx.json({ success: true }));
  })
);

beforeAll(() => server.listen());
afterEach(() => server.resetHandlers());
afterAll(() => server.close());

describe('ContactPage', () => {
  it('submits the form correctly', async () => {
    render(<ContactPage />);
    
    fireEvent.change(screen.getByLabelText(/name/i), {
      target: { value: 'John Doe' },
    });
    
    fireEvent.change(screen.getByLabelText(/email/i), {
      target: { value: 'john@example.com' },
    });
    
    fireEvent.change(screen.getByLabelText(/message/i), {
      target: { value: 'Hello, world!' },
    });
    
    fireEvent.click(screen.getByText(/submit/i));
    
    await waitFor(() => {
      expect(screen.getByText(/thank you/i)).toBeInTheDocument();
    });
  });
});
```

### 3. End-to-End Testing

End-to-end testing focuses on testing the entire application from the user's perspective.

#### Tools

- **Cypress**: End-to-end testing framework
- **Playwright**: Browser automation library

#### What to Test

- **User Flows**: Test common user flows, such as navigating to a page, filling out a form, and submitting it
- **Responsive Design**: Test that the website works correctly on different screen sizes
- **Browser Compatibility**: Test that the website works correctly on different browsers

#### Example

```javascript
// cypress/integration/contact.spec.js
describe('Contact Page', () => {
  it('submits the contact form', () => {
    cy.visit('/contact');
    
    cy.get('input[name="name"]').type('John Doe');
    cy.get('input[name="email"]').type('john@example.com');
    cy.get('textarea[name="message"]').type('Hello, world!');
    
    cy.get('button[type="submit"]').click();
    
    cy.contains('Thank you for your message!').should('be.visible');
  });
});
```

### 4. Visual Regression Testing

Visual regression testing focuses on detecting visual changes in the UI.

#### Tools

- **Storybook**: UI component development environment
- **Chromatic**: Visual testing platform
- **Percy**: Visual testing platform

#### What to Test

- **Component Appearance**: Test that components look as expected
- **Page Layout**: Test that pages have the correct layout
- **Responsive Design**: Test that the website looks correct on different screen sizes

#### Example

```javascript
// src/components/Button.stories.jsx
import Button from './Button';

export default {
  title: 'Components/Button',
  component: Button,
};

export const Primary = () => <Button variant="primary">Primary Button</Button>;
export const Secondary = () => <Button variant="secondary">Secondary Button</Button>;
export const Large = () => <Button size="large">Large Button</Button>;
export const Small = () => <Button size="small">Small Button</Button>;
```

### 5. Performance Testing

Performance testing focuses on measuring the performance of the website.

#### Tools

- **Lighthouse**: Performance, accessibility, and SEO auditing tool
- **WebPageTest**: Performance testing tool
- **Next.js Analytics**: Built-in performance analytics

#### What to Test

- **Page Load Time**: Test how long it takes for pages to load
- **Time to Interactive**: Test how long it takes for pages to become interactive
- **First Contentful Paint**: Test how long it takes for the first content to appear
- **Largest Contentful Paint**: Test how long it takes for the largest content to appear
- **Cumulative Layout Shift**: Test how much the layout shifts during loading

#### Example

```bash
# Run Lighthouse audit
npx lighthouse https://www.windowworldla.com --view
```

### 6. Accessibility Testing

Accessibility testing focuses on ensuring that the website is accessible to all users, including those with disabilities.

#### Tools

- **axe**: Accessibility testing library
- **WAVE**: Web accessibility evaluation tool
- **Lighthouse**: Accessibility auditing tool

#### What to Test

- **Keyboard Navigation**: Test that the website can be navigated using only the keyboard
- **Screen Reader Compatibility**: Test that the website works correctly with screen readers
- **Color Contrast**: Test that the website has sufficient color contrast
- **Alt Text**: Test that images have appropriate alt text

#### Example

```jsx
// src/components/Button.test.jsx
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import { axe } from 'jest-axe';
import Button from './Button';

describe('Button', () => {
  it('has no accessibility violations', async () => {
    const { container } = render(<Button>Click me</Button>);
    const results = await axe(container);
    expect(results).toHaveNoViolations();
  });
});
```

## Testing Process

### 1. Local Development Testing

During local development, developers should:

1. Write unit tests for new components and functions
2. Run existing tests to ensure that changes don't break existing functionality
3. Manually test changes in the browser

### 2. Continuous Integration Testing

When changes are pushed to the repository, the continuous integration (CI) pipeline should:

1. Run all unit and integration tests
2. Run linting and type checking
3. Build the application to ensure it compiles correctly

### 3. Pre-Deployment Testing

Before deploying to production, the following tests should be run:

1. End-to-end tests to ensure that the application works correctly as a whole
2. Visual regression tests to ensure that the UI hasn't changed unexpectedly
3. Performance tests to ensure that the application performs well
4. Accessibility tests to ensure that the application is accessible

### 4. Post-Deployment Testing

After deploying to production, the following tests should be run:

1. Smoke tests to ensure that the application is running correctly
2. Performance monitoring to ensure that the application continues to perform well
3. Error monitoring to catch any errors that occur in production

## Test Coverage

The goal is to achieve at least 80% test coverage for the codebase. This includes:

- 100% coverage for utility functions
- 80% coverage for components
- 70% coverage for pages

## Testing Best Practices

1. **Write Tests First**: Follow a test-driven development (TDD) approach when possible
2. **Keep Tests Simple**: Tests should be easy to understand and maintain
3. **Test Behavior, Not Implementation**: Focus on testing what the code does, not how it does it
4. **Use Realistic Data**: Use realistic data in tests to ensure they reflect real-world usage
5. **Run Tests Regularly**: Run tests frequently during development to catch issues early
6. **Automate Testing**: Automate as much of the testing process as possible
7. **Monitor Test Performance**: Ensure that tests run quickly to maintain developer productivity
