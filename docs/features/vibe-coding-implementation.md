## Overview

This document serves as the central tracking resource for the implementation of 10 IDE features inspired by David Jones Gelardi's "Vibe Coding" approach. These features are designed to enhance our development workflow, improve code quality, and streamline collaboration between developers and AI tools.

The Vibe Coding approach emphasizes:
- Frequent, small commits
- Modular, maintainable code
- Clear task management
- Consistent file organization
- Automated assistance for repetitive tasks
- AI-enhanced development workflows
