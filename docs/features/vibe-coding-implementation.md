## Overview

This document serves as the central tracking resource for the implementation of 10 IDE features inspired by David Jones Gelardi's "Vibe Coding" approach. These features are designed to enhance our development workflow, improve code quality, and streamline collaboration between developers and AI tools.

The Vibe Coding approach emphasizes:
- Frequent, small commits
- Modular, maintainable code
- Clear task management
- Consistent file organization
- Automated assistance for repetitive tasks
- AI-enhanced development workflows

## Feature Details

### 1. Intelligent Commit Reminders & Assistance

**Status**: ✅ Completed

**Description**: Provides timely reminders to commit changes and assistance in creating meaningful commit messages. This feature helps developers maintain good version control practices by encouraging frequent, small commits.

**Key Components**:
- Time-based commit reminders
- Change-based commit reminders
- AI-generated commit messages
- Pre-commit validation
- Git hooks integration

**Documentation**: [Intelligent Commit Reminders](./intelligent-commit-reminders.md)

**Daily Log**: [May 29, 2025 - Implementation](../daily-logs/2025-05-29-intelligent-commit-reminders-implementation.md)

### 2. Code Modularity & Refactoring Tools

**Status**: ✅ Completed

**Description**: Helps developers maintain clean, modular code by analyzing files for complexity and length, identifying code that could benefit from modularization, and suggesting AI-powered refactoring options.

**Key Components**:
- Code complexity analysis
- Modularization suggestions
- AI-powered refactoring
- Configurable thresholds
- IDE integration

**Documentation**: [Code Modularity Tools](./code-modularity-tools.md)

**Daily Log**: [May 30, 2025 - Implementation](../daily-logs/2025-05-30-code-modularity-tools-implementation.md)

### 3. To-Do List Management with AI Sync

**Status**: ✅ Completed

**Description**: Provides a seamless, project-aware task management system that integrates directly with the development workflow. This feature allows developers to quickly add, update, and complete tasks, while also enabling AI assistants to interact with the task list.

**Key Components**:
- To-Do List Manager
- File System Integration
- Command Line Interface
- AI Integration
- Notification System

**Documentation**: [To-Do List Management](./todo-list-management.md)

**Daily Log**: [May 31, 2025 - Implementation](../daily-logs/2025-05-31-todo-list-management-implementation.md)

### 4. File Naming Convention

**Status**: ✅ Completed

**Description**: Implements a standardized file naming convention that uses hyphenated path names instead of directory separators and requires a concise 5-7 word description for each file. This approach makes files easier to find and reference.

**Key Components**:
- Hyphenated path names
- Kebab case naming
- Path context inclusion
- Descriptive naming rules
- Consistent naming patterns

**Documentation**: [File Naming Convention](../processes/file-naming-convention.md)

## Implementation Process

Each Vibe Coding feature follows a standardized implementation process:

1. **Planning**: Define the feature requirements, components, and implementation approach
2. **Development**: Implement the feature according to the plan
3. **Documentation**: Create comprehensive documentation for the feature
4. **Testing**: Test the feature to ensure it works as expected
5. **Integration**: Integrate the feature with the existing development workflow
6. **Release**: Make the feature available to all developers
