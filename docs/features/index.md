3. **To-Do List Management with AI Sync**: Provides a seamless, project-aware task management system that integrates directly with the development workflow.
4. **File Naming Convention**: Implements a standardized file naming convention that uses hyphenated path names instead of directory separators.

**Planned Features (6 of 10):**
5. **Code Audit Detection**: Automatically detects code quality issues, potential bugs, and areas for improvement.
6. **Automated Testing**: Streamlines the testing process by automatically generating and running tests for new code.
7. **AI Rule Configuration**: Allows developers to configure AI behavior and rules for code generation, review, and assistance.
8. **Automation Scripting**: Provides a framework for creating and running automation scripts for common development tasks.
9. **AI Change Review**: Automatically reviews code changes for quality, adherence to standards, and potential issues.
10. **Multi-Agent Comparison**: Allows developers to compare outputs from multiple AI agents for the same task.
