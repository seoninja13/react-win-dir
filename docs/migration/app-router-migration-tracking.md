## Overview

This document tracks the progress of migrating the Windows Doors CA website from using a mix of Pages Router and App Router to using only the App Router. This migration is critical for simplifying the codebase, reducing routing conflicts, and aligning with Next.js best practices.

## Known Issues

### 1. Routing Conflicts

**Issue**: Pages with both Pages Router and App Router implementations experience routing conflicts, with the Pages Router taking precedence.

**Affected Pages**:
- Bay-Bow Windows
- Hinged Patio Doors
- All Vinyl Siding Series Pages

**Solution**:
1. Temporarily rename or move the Pages Router implementations to allow the App Router implementations to take precedence
2. Eventually, remove all Pages Router implementations once the App Router versions are confirmed working

### 2. Simplified Debug Versions

**Issue**: Some pages have simplified debug versions that were created for testing purposes.

**Affected Pages**:
- Garage Doors

**Solution**:
1. Remove or rename simplified debug versions of pages to avoid conflicts
2. Ensure all pages use the actual implementations with proper components

### 3. Inconsistent Directory Structure

**Issue**: The project has a mix of directory structures, with some pages in `src/app/` and others in `Relume-root/src/app/`.

**Solution**:
1. Ensure all App Router pages are in `Relume-root/src/app/` and not in `src/app/`
2. Update import paths to reflect the correct directory structure

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (May 28-29, 2025)

1. **Resolve Routing Conflicts**:
   - Temporarily rename Pages Router implementations for Bay-Bow Windows, Hinged Patio Doors, and Vinyl Siding Series Pages
   - Test each page to ensure the App Router implementation is being used

2. **Remove Simplified Debug Versions**:
   - Remove or rename the simplified debug version of the Garage Doors page
   - Test the page to ensure the actual implementation is being used

### Short-Term Actions (May 30 - June 5, 2025)

1. **Standardize Directory Structure**:
   - Ensure all App Router pages are in `Relume-root/src/app/` and not in `src/app/`
   - Update import paths to reflect the correct directory structure

2. **Migrate High-Priority Pages**:
   - Entry Doors
   - Patio Doors
   - Awning Windows
   - Picture Windows

### Medium-Term Actions (June 6-12, 2025)

1. **Migrate Remaining Windows Pages**:
   - Sliding Windows
   - Custom Windows
   - Energy Efficient Windows

2. **Migrate Informational Pages**:
   - About
   - Contact
   - FAQs

### Long-Term Actions (June 13-19, 2025)

1. **Remove Pages Router Implementations**:
   - Once all pages have been migrated and tested, remove all Pages Router implementations
   - Update documentation to reflect the completed migration

2. **Final Testing and Verification**:
   - Test all pages to ensure they work correctly
   - Verify that all internal links use the correct paths
   - Update any remaining documentation
