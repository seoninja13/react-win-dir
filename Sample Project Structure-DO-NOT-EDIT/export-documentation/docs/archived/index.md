# Archived Documentation

> **Breadcrumb Navigation**: [README.md](../../README.md) > [Documentation](../index.md) > Archived Documentation

This directory contains archived documentation that is no longer actively maintained but is kept for historical reference. These documents may contain outdated information and should not be used as a primary source of information.

## Deprecated Files

The following files have been deprecated and moved to this directory:

- [immediate-next-steps.md](./immediate-next-steps.md) - Replaced by [Project Tasks](../../project-tasks.md)
- [tracking-progress.md](./tracking-progress.md) - Replaced by [Project Tasks](../../project-tasks.md)
- [next-steps.md](./next-steps.md) - Replaced by [Project Tasks](../../project-tasks.md)

## Why We Archive

Rather than deleting old documentation, we archive it to:

1. Preserve historical context and decisions
2. Maintain a record of previous approaches
3. Provide reference for understanding legacy code or features
4. Allow for retrieval of information that might become relevant again

## Using Archived Documentation

When referring to archived documentation:

1. Always check if there is a newer version in the active documentation
2. Note that the information may be outdated or no longer applicable
3. Consider the archive date when evaluating the relevance of the information
4. If you find valuable information that should be in the active documentation, suggest updating the current docs rather than relying on the archived version

## Archive Process

When a document is archived:

1. It is moved to this directory
2. A notice is added at the top indicating it is archived and pointing to any replacement
3. The original location is updated with a redirect or removal notice
4. All references to the document in active documentation are updated
