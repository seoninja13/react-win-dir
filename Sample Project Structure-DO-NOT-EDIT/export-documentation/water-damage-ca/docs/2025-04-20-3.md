# April 20, 2025 (Evening) - Admin Subroutes Testing Plan

## Overview

Today's work focused on creating a comprehensive testing plan for the admin subroutes in the Water Damage CA project. This plan will serve as a guide for implementing unit tests, integration tests, and manual testing procedures to ensure the reliability and functionality of the admin interface.

## Changes Made

### 1. Testing Documentation

- Created a new `admin-subroutes-testing.md` document with:
  - Detailed testing approach for each admin subroute
  - Unit test specifications for all components
  - Integration test specifications for critical paths
  - Manual testing checklists
  - Test file organization structure
  - Implementation strategy and phases
  - Test coverage goals

- Updated the main README.md to include a link to the new testing plan

### 2. Testing Approach

The testing plan follows a comprehensive approach:

1. **Unit Testing**
   - Testing individual components and functions in isolation
   - Using React Testing Library for component testing
   - Focusing on form validation and state management

2. **Integration Testing**
   - Testing interactions between components and external services
   - Mocking Supabase and API endpoints
   - Verifying end-to-end flows

3. **Manual Testing**
   - Detailed checklists for each route
   - Focusing on functionality, usability, and visual appearance
   - Documenting any issues found

### 3. Routes Covered

The testing plan covers all admin subroutes:

1. Main Admin Dashboard (`/admin`)
2. Batch Process (`/admin/batch-process`)
3. Cities Management (`/admin/cities`)
4. Businesses Management (`/admin/businesses`)
5. Enrich Businesses (`/admin/enrich-businesses`)

## Technical Details

### Test File Organization

```
water-damage-ca/
├── __tests__/
│   ├── unit/
│   │   ├── admin/
│   │   │   ├── AdminLayout.test.tsx
│   │   │   ├── batch-process/
│   │   │   ├── cities/
│   │   │   ├── businesses/

│   │   └── lib/
│   └── integration/
│       ├── admin/
│       └── api/
└── ...
```

### Implementation Strategy

The testing plan outlines a phased approach:

1. Setup testing infrastructure
2. Implement unit tests for critical components
3. Implement integration tests for database and API operations
4. Perform manual testing following detailed checklists
5. Fix issues and run regression tests

## Next Steps

1. **Setup Testing Environment**
   - Configure Jest and React Testing Library
   - Set up mock services for Supabase and API endpoints
   - Create test utilities and helpers

2. **Begin Unit Test Implementation**
   - Start with the AdminLayout component
   - Implement tests for the Batch Process page
   - Focus on form validation and state management

3. **Begin Manual Testing**
   - Start with the main admin dashboard
   - Test navigation between routes
   - Document any issues found
