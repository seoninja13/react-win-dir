## Last Update (04/15/2025)

- Completed documentation structure improvements
- Fixed markdown linting issues in tracking-progress.md
- Documented batch processing implementation

## Immediate Actions

1. **Batch Processing Implementation**

   - [ ] Implement city data enrichment batch processing
   - [ ] Add rate limiting and error handling
   - [ ] Set up monitoring for API usage
   - [ ] Test with initial batch of 10 cities

2. **API Cost Optimization**

   - [ ] Implement field masks for Places API calls
   - [ ] Set up 6-month file-based caching
   - [ ] Configure maxResultCount=20 for optimal API usage
   - [ ] Verify minimum required fields configuration

3. **Documentation & Testing**

   - [ ] Complete batch processing documentation
   - [ ] Add unit tests for batch processing
   - [ ] Set up monitoring dashboard
   - [ ] Document API cost optimization measures

## Test Cities Batch

Initial test batch (10 cities):

1. Los Angeles (existing - control)
2. Sacramento (existing - control)
3. Fresno (new)
4. Oakland (new)
5. Santa Clara (new)
6. Riverside (new)
7. Bakersfield (new)
8. Stockton (new)
9. Modesto (new)
10. Santa Rosa (new)

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Successfully identify new cities
- [ ] Fetch GBP data for new cities
- [ ] Enrich GBP data
- [ ] Store results in database
- [ ] Complete process within rate limits
- [ ] Handle errors gracefully

## Monitoring Metrics

- API calls per city
- Processing time per city
- Success rate
- Cache hit rate
- Error rate
- Data quality metrics

## Branch Status

- Current branch: `feature/batch-processing`

- Next steps:
  1. Implement batch processing logic
  2. Add monitoring and logging
  3. Test with initial city batch
  4. Submit PR for review

## Notes

- Using Supabase for data storage (Google Sheets deprecated)
- Implementing cost optimization strategies for Places API
- Focus on monitoring and error handling
- Need to validate data quality for each city
