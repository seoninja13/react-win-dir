## Getting Started

### 1. Environment Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install` or `yarn install`
3. Copy `.env.template` to `.env.local` and fill in the required values:
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`: The URL of your Supabase project
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: The anonymous key for your Supabase project
   - `GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY`: API key for Google Places API
   - `GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY`: API key for Google Gemini
   - `PERPLEXITY_API_KEY`: API key for Perplexity

### 2. Testing Supabase Integration

Verify your Supabase connection by running the development server and checking the API routes.

### 3. Running the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

The site will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Current Project Status

Check `Roadmap/tracking-progress.md` for the current status of the project and upcoming tasks. As of February 27, 2025:

- Supabase database integration is complete
- Type definitions for business, service, and city data are implemented
- Next steps include implementing dynamic routing and page templates

## API Integrations

### Supabase Database

The project uses Supabase as the primary data source for business and service information:

- **Integration**: Implemented in `lib/database.ts`
- **API Routes**: Various routes in `app/api/supabase/` handle database operations

### Google Places API

We use the Google Places API to fetch business data for specific cities:

- **Integration**: Implemented in `lib/api/googlePlaces.ts` with caching mechanism
- **API Route**: `app/api/business/by-city/route.ts` handles city-specific business data requests
- **Environment Variables**:
  - `GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY`: API key for Google Places API

#### Places API Workflow

1. User searches for businesses in a specific city
2. System checks Supabase for cached data
3. If data is not cached or outdated, it fetches from Places API
4. Results are cached in Supabase for future use
5. Up to 10 businesses are returned per location

#### Testing Places API

To test the Places API integration:

```powershell
# Direct API test
$apiKey = (Get-Content .env.local | Select-String "GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY").Line.Split('=')[1].Trim()
curl "https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/place/textsearch/json?query=water%20damage%20Los%20Angeles%20CA&key=$apiKey"

# API route test
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/business/by-city?city=Sacramento"
```
