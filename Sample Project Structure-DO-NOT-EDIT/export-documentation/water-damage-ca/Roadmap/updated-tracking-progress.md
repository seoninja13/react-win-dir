## Notes & Decisions
- Google Gemini 2.5 Pro is the preferred AI service for enriching listings due to being free
- Perplexity is the secondary choice for enriching listings with online information
- Supabase is being used for backend data storage
- The application will be deployed to a website (domain TBD)
- The project adapts existing files and structures rather than creating new ones
- Caching strategy: 6-month ISR (15,552,000 seconds)
- Google Places API cost optimization:
  - Using field masks to request only necessary fields
  - Implementing 6-month file-based caching to reduce API calls
  - Maximizing results per request (20 businesses per call)
  - Limiting display to top 10 businesses per location
