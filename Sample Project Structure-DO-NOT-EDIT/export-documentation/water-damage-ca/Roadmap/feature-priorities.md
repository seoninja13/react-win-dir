## Implementation Workflow

For each feature, follow this workflow:

3. **Testing**: Write and run unit tests to verify functionality
4. **Documentation**: Update documentation to reflect changes
5. **Review**: Conduct code review and make necessary adjustments
6. **Deployment**: Deploy changes to the production environment

## Current Focus

Based on the prioritization, we should focus on completing all Priority 1 items first, followed by Priority 2 items. The LeadForm component (Priority 5) has already been implemented ahead of schedule.

The next features to implement should be:
