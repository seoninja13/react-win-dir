# Development Workflow

This document outlines the standard operational workflow for the Water Damage CA project, providing clear step-by-step instructions for implementing features, testing, and documentation.

## Complete Development Cycle

### 1. Feature Planning and Preparation

1. **Review Feature Requirements**
   - Check the [Feature Priorities](./feature-priorities.md) document to identify the next feature to implement
   - Review the [Project Requirements](./project-requirements.md) for detailed specifications

2. **Create Feature Branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/feature-name
   ```

3. **Plan Implementation**
   - Break down the feature into smaller tasks
   - Identify components, utilities, and API endpoints needed
   - Consider data requirements and state management

### 2. Feature Implementation

1. **Implement Core Functionality**
   - Create or modify necessary components
   - Implement required utilities and helpers
   - Set up API endpoints if needed
   - Ensure proper error handling

2. **Add Types and Interfaces**
   - Define TypeScript interfaces for all data structures
   - Ensure proper typing for functions and components
   - Update existing types if necessary

3. **Implement UI Components**
   - Create responsive UI components
   - Ensure accessibility compliance
   - Follow the established design system

4. **Integrate with Data Sources**
   - Connect to Supabase for data storage and retrieval
   - Implement Google Places API integration if needed
   - Set up proper caching mechanisms

### 3. Testing

1. **Write Unit Tests**
   - Create tests for all new components and utilities
   - Test edge cases and error handling
   - Aim for at least 85% code coverage

2. **Run Tests**
   ```bash
   # Run all tests
   npm test
   
   # Run tests for a specific file
   npm test -- __tests__/path/to/test.test.ts
   
   # Run tests with coverage
   npm run test:coverage
   ```

3. **Fix Failing Tests**
   - Address any test failures immediately
   - Do not proceed to the next step until all tests pass
   - Document any known issues that cannot be immediately resolved

4. **Manual Testing**
   - Test the feature in the browser
   - Verify functionality across different screen sizes
   - Check for any UI/UX issues

### 4. Documentation

1. **Update Code Documentation**
   - Add JSDoc comments to functions and components
   - Document complex logic and algorithms
   - Update type definitions

2. **Update Project Documentation**
   - Update [Tracking Progress](./tracking-progress.md) with completed feature
   - Document any special considerations or limitations
   - Update README if necessary

3. **Document Test Results**
   - Record test coverage metrics
   - Document any edge cases or limitations discovered during testing
   - Note any performance considerations

### 5. Code Review and Submission

1. **Prepare Pull Request**
   - Ensure code follows project style guidelines
   - Fix any linting issues
   - Write a clear PR description with feature details

2. **Submit for Review**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Implement [Feature Name] with tests and documentation"
   git push origin feature/feature-name
   ```

3. **Address Review Feedback**
   - Make requested changes
   - Re-run tests after changes
   - Update documentation if necessary

### 6. Deployment

1. **Merge to Main Branch**
   - After approval, merge the feature branch to main
   - Ensure CI/CD pipeline passes

2. **Verify Deployment**
   - Check the deployed feature in the staging environment
   - Verify functionality in production after deployment

3. **Monitor for Issues**
   - Watch for any errors or performance issues
   - Address any post-deployment issues promptly

## Best Practices

1. **Commit Often**
   - Make small, focused commits
   - Use descriptive commit messages
   - Reference issue numbers when applicable

2. **Test-Driven Development**
   - Write tests before or alongside implementation
   - Ensure all edge cases are covered
   - Maintain high code coverage

3. **Documentation First**
   - Document complex functionality as you implement it
   - Keep documentation up-to-date with code changes
   - Use clear, concise language

4. **Code Quality**
   - Follow established coding standards
   - Use meaningful variable and function names
   - Keep functions small and focused on a single responsibility

5. **Performance Considerations**
   - Optimize database queries
   - Implement proper caching
   - Minimize unnecessary re-renders in React components

By following this workflow, we ensure consistent, high-quality feature implementation with proper testing and documentation throughout the development process.
