## Batch Processing and Testing Implementation

Today's work focused on implementing and testing the batch processing functionality and the OpenRouter Web Search MCP integration.

### Files Created/Modified

1. **Test Scripts**
   - `scripts/test-batch-processing.ts` - Integration test for batch processing
   - `scripts/test-openrouter-search.ts` - Integration test for OpenRouter Web Search MCP
   - `__tests__/openRouterSearch.test.ts` - Unit tests for OpenRouter Web Search MCP
   - `__tests__/batchProcessor.test.ts` - Unit tests for batch processing

2. **Batch Files**
   - `run-batch-processing-tests.bat` - Batch file to run integration tests
   - `run-unit-tests.bat` - Batch file to run unit tests

3. **Documentation Updates**
   - `docs/batch-processing.md` - Updated with testing information
   - `docs/immediate-next-steps.md` - Updated to reflect completed tasks

### Key Implementations

1. **Batch Processing Tests**
   - Unit tests for state management
   - Unit tests for error handling
   - Integration tests for the complete batch processing flow
   - Real-time monitoring of batch process progress
   - Verification of database updates

2. **OpenRouter Web Search MCP Tests**
   - Unit tests for business profile enrichment
   - Unit tests for batch enrichment
   - Unit tests for caching functionality
   - Integration tests for web search functionality
   - Verification of enriched data structure

### Testing Approach

1. **Unit Testing**
   - Mocked dependencies for isolated testing
   - Tested error handling and edge cases
   - Verified state management and data flow

2. **Integration Testing**
   - Tested with real API calls
   - Monitored progress in real-time
   - Verified database updates
   - Validated enriched data structure

### Next Steps

1. **UI Components for Enriched Data**
   - Create UI components to display the enriched data on business profile pages
   - Implement components for review insights, service details, remediation process, and restoration techniques

2. **End-to-End Testing**
   - Add end-to-end tests for the enrichment process
   - Test the complete flow from UI to database

3. **Optimization**
   - Improve search query generation for better results
   - Enhance processing of search results
   - Implement more sophisticated caching strategies
