## Google Places API Integration Fixes

Today's work focused on fixing the Google Places API integration to ensure proper data retrieval for the batch processing system.

### Files Modified

1. `lib/api/googlePlaces.ts`
   - Improved error handling for API responses
   - Added better debugging and logging
   - Fixed caching implementation for server-side environments
   - Added detailed request and response logging
   - Enhanced mock data generation for development mode

### Key Changes

1. **Error Handling Improvements**
   - Added specific handling for non-OK responses
   - Added detection for error messages in response text
   - Improved fallback to mock data in development mode
   - Added detailed error logging with context

2. **API Request Format**
   - Added proper Accept header
   - Added detailed logging of API requests
   - Ensured correct field masks are used

3. **Cache Implementation**
   - Added checks for server-side environments

   - Improved error handling for cache operations

4. **Mock Data Generation**
   - Enhanced mock data to better match real API responses
   - Added more realistic business data
   - Improved city and service extraction from search queries

### Testing

- Tested the Google Places API directly with PowerShell
- Verified that the API returns the expected data format
- Confirmed that the batch processing system works with the fixed API integration
- Tested the fallback to mock data in development mode

### Next Steps

1. Implement data enrichment using the OpenRouter Web Search MCP server
2. Update the UI to display enriched data
3. Add unit tests for the Google Places API integration
4. Add integration tests for the batch processing functionality
