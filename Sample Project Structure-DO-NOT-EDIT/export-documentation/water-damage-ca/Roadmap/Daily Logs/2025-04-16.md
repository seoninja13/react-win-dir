## TypeScript Interface Fixes

Today's work focused on fixing TypeScript type mismatches across multiple files to ensure proper compliance with the `BusinessDetails` interface.

### Files Modified

1. `app/[...slug]/page.tsx`
   - Removed unsupported properties from `city` object
   - Fixed service schema generation
   - Added proper type handling for address objects

2. `app/[service]-[city]-ca/page.tsx`
   - Removed `id` and `slug` from `city` object
   - Corrected schema property names
   - Added proper address object structure

3. `app/test-components/business-profile/page.tsx`
   - Fixed `city` object structure
   - Added null checks for nested properties
   - Corrected hours format from array to object

4. `app/test-components/direct-business-profile/page.tsx`
   - Removed unsupported properties
   - Added width and height to photo objects
   - Fixed hours format

5. `app/test-components/page.tsx`
   - Removed extra properties from mock data
   - Fixed hours and photos structure
   - Added proper type handling

6. `app/test-gbp/page.tsx`
   - Fixed data transformation
   - Added proper error handling for unknown types
   - Added null checks for nested properties

### Key Changes

1. BusinessDetails Interface Compliance
   - Removed unsupported properties:
     - `id`
     - `slug`
     - `place_id`
     - `review_count`
     - `reviews`

2. City Object Structure
   - Simplified to only include:
     - `name: string`
     - `state: string`

3. Hours Format
   - Changed from array of objects to record:
   ```typescript
   // Before
   hours: [
     { day: 'Monday', open: '08:00', close: '18:00' }
   ]
   
   // After
   hours: {
     Monday: '08:00-18:00'
   }
   ```

4. Photos Structure
   - Added required properties:
   ```typescript
   photos: [
     {
       reference: string,
       width: number,
       height: number
     }
   ]
   ```

5. Null Safety
   - Added optional chaining for nested properties
   - Added fallback values for nullable fields

### Testing

All files have been tested with the TypeScript compiler to ensure type safety. The build process now completes without any type errors.

### Next Steps

1. Update unit tests to reflect the new type structure
2. Review other components that might use the BusinessDetails interface
3. Consider adding runtime type validation using a schema validation library
