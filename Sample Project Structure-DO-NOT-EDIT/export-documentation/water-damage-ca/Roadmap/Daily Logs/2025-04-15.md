## PWA Implementation and Image Optimization

This afternoon we addressed PWA icon issues and improved image optimization for the Water Damage CA project.

### Tasks Completed

1. **Added PWA Icon Placeholders**
   - Created apple-touch-icon.png (180x180)
   - Created icon-192x192.png (192x192)
   - Created icon-512x512.png (512x512)
   - Created favicon.ico
   - Fixed manifest.json icon configuration

2. **Image Optimization**
   - Added cdn.pixabay.com to allowed image domains in next.config.js
   - Updated image loading configuration
   - Fixed image-related console errors

3. **Documentation Updates**
   - Created memory for PWA implementation status
   - Updated tracking-progress.md with PWA changes
   - Updated project-status.md with latest progress

### Next Steps

1. **PWA Icon Implementation**
   - Design brand-consistent icons for all sizes
   - Create optimized icon files
   - Test PWA installation flow
   - Verify icon display across platforms

2. **Image Optimization**
   - Monitor image loading performance
   - Implement lazy loading where appropriate
   - Test image display across devices

### Notes

- PWA icons are currently placeholders and need to be replaced with brand-consistent designs
- The manifest.json is properly configured for PWA support
- Image optimization is in place with proper domain configuration

## OpenRouter Web Search MCP Server Implementation

Today we successfully implemented the OpenRouter Web Search MCP server for the Water Damage CA project. This server provides web search capabilities powered by AI models from OpenRouter.

### Tasks Completed

1. **Created OpenRouter MCP Server Implementation**
   - Developed the server.js file with MCP protocol support
   - Implemented web search functionality using the OpenRouter API
   - Added support for primary and fallback models
   - Implemented rate limiting to prevent API quota exhaustion

2. **Configured OpenRouter MCP Server**
   - Added the server configuration to .mcp.json
   - Created a batch file for easy server startup
   - Created a verification script to check the installation

3. **Created Test Scripts**
   - Implemented a Node.js test script for command-line testing
   - Created an HTML test page for browser-based testing
   - Added examples of direct API calls for testing

4. **Created Documentation**
   - Created comprehensive documentation in docs/openrouter-search-integration.md
   - Updated README.md with references to the new documentation
   - Updated tracking-progress.md to include the implementation as completed
   - Added examples of integration with Next.js components

### Server Capabilities

The OpenRouter Web Search MCP server provides a single tool:

- **openrouter_web_search**: Performs web searches and returns relevant results

The server uses two AI models:
- Primary: Optimus Alpha (openrouter/optimus-alpha)
- Fallback: Google Gemini 2.0 Flash (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001)

If the primary model is unavailable, the server automatically falls back to the secondary model, ensuring high availability.

### Integration with Next.js

The documentation includes examples of how to integrate the OpenRouter MCP server with Next.js components and API routes. This allows developers to easily add web search capabilities to the Water Damage CA project.

### Next Steps

1. **Content Enrichment Integration**
   - Integrate the OpenRouter MCP server with the content enrichment workflow
   - Create a UI for searching and using search results
   - Compare results with the Brave Search MCP server for quality and relevance

2. **Testing and Optimization**
   - Create unit tests for the OpenRouter MCP server
   - Optimize the server for performance and reliability
   - Implement caching to reduce API calls

3. **Documentation Updates**
   - Add more examples and use cases
   - Create tutorials for common workflows
   - Update the developer guide with OpenRouter information

### Notes

- The OpenRouter API requires an API key, which should be set in the OPENROUTER_API_KEY environment variable
- The server runs on port 8889 to avoid conflicts with other MCP servers
- The rate limiting is set to 10 requests per minute and 100 requests per hour
- The server can be customized by modifying the models, rate limits, and other parameters
