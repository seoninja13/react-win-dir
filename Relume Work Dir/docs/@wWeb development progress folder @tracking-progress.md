# Development Progress Log

## May 18, 2025: Vertex AI Image Generation Setup

- **Feature Implemented**: Successfully configured and executed the Vertex AI image generation test script.
- **Details**: This involved setting up a new service account (`windows-doors-v2@...`) in the `windows-doors-website-dir-v2` GCP project, configuring IAM roles (`Vertex AI Administrator`), enabling the Vertex AI API, updating local environment variables (`.env.local`), and refining the `esbuild` command to handle Google SDKs as external modules.
- **Documentation**:
  - Created daily log: `docs/daily-logs/2025-05-18.md`
  - Created feature documentation: `docs/features/vertex-ai-image-generation.md`
  - Created setup guide: `docs/processes/vertex-ai-setup-guide.md`
- **Status**: Fully functional and documented.

## May 19, 2025: Build Error Debugging

- **Feature:** Build Error Debugging (`debug` and `supports-color`)
- **Change:** Further refined `next.config.js`.
  - Set `transpilePackages: ['gaxios']`.
  - For client builds, added Webpack alias `config.resolve.alias['https-proxy-agent'] = false;`.
  - Kept existing fallback for `supports-color` and aliases for `debug` and `debug/src/node.js`.
- **Goal:** Prevent `https-proxy-agent` and its dependency `debug` (Node.js version) from being included in the client bundle.
- **Status:** Pending build test.
- **Feature:** Build Error Debugging (`debug` and `supports-color`) - Attempt #N
- **Change:** Modified `next.config.js` again.
  - Set `transpilePackages: ['gaxios', 'https-proxy-agent']`.
  - Kept client-side Webpack fallbacks and aliases: `supports-color: false` (fallback), `debug: 'debug/src/browser.js'`, `debug/src/node.js: 'debug/src/browser.js'`, `https-proxy-agent: false` (aliases).
- **Goal:** Ensure correct module resolution for client bundle by transpiling potentially problematic CJS packages while explicitly aliasing Node-specific parts to browser-friendly or empty versions.
- **Status:** Pending cache clearing and build test.

## May 19, 2025: Project Organization and Documentation

### Documentation Structure Updates

1. **Build Configuration Documentation**
   - Created comprehensive build configuration guide
   - Documented Webpack configuration for Node.js module compatibility
   - Added troubleshooting steps for common build issues
   - Located at: `docs/architecture/build-configuration.md`

2. **Project Structure Reorganization**
   - Moved Supabase directory to `Relume-root/Supabase`
   - Archived old Supabase files to `Supabase-OLD`
   - Updated API routes structure
   - Added admin interface scaffolding

3. **Documentation Improvements**
   - Updated architecture documentation with build configuration details
   - Added section for Node.js module compatibility
   - Documented Vertex AI integration progress
   - Added new sections for error handling and troubleshooting

### Status

- Documentation structure is being updated to follow pyramidal hierarchy
- Build configuration documentation is complete
- Project structure reorganization is in progress

## May 19, 2025: Build Error Debugging - Final Client-Side Nullification Attempt

- **Change:** Modified `next.config.js`.
  - `transpilePackages`: `['gaxios', 'https-proxy-agent']` (kept).
  - Client-side Webpack aliases/fallbacks:
    - `config.resolve.alias['debug'] = false;` (New: directly nullify debug for client).
    - `config.resolve.alias['https-proxy-agent'] = false;` (Kept).
    - `config.resolve.fallback['supports-color'] = false;` (Kept).
    - Removed alias for `debug/src/node.js` as `debug: false` should cover it.
- **Goal:** Aggressively prevent `debug` and its problematic Node.js parts from affecting the client bundle by aliasing `debug` itself to `false`.
- **Status:** Pending cache clearing and build test.

## May 19, 2025: Admin Interface Development

### Phase 1: Basic Scaffolding

- **Feature**: Admin Interface Structure and Placeholders
- **Details**:
  - Created the main admin route at `Relume-root/src/app/admin/` including:
    - `page.tsx`: Basic dashboard layout with tabbed navigation.
    - `layout.tsx`: Basic layout for the admin section.
  - Created Supabase admin client at `Relume-root/src/lib/supabase/adminClient.ts` for privileged operations.
  - Added placeholder UI tabs in the admin dashboard for:
    - Database Management
    - Content Management (Per Page/Product)
    - User Management
    - Content Engine / Generative Tools (New)
    - Settings
  - Created a placeholder `ContentEngine` module at `Relume-root/src/lib/content-engine/index.ts` with placeholder functions for `generateContent` and `generateImage`.
- **Status**: Basic structure and UI placeholders are in place.

### Phase 2: Products CRUD Implementation

- **Feature**: Complete CRUD Operations for Products
- **Details**:
  - Created new components:
    - `ProductsCrud.tsx`: Main CRUD interface with table view and modals
    - `ProductForm.tsx`: Reusable form component for create/edit operations
  - Implemented features:
    - Product listing with responsive table
    - Create new product with validation
    - Edit existing products
    - Delete products with confirmation
    - Error handling and loading states
  - Form fields:
    - Name (required)
    - Slug (required)
    - Category (required, with predefined options)
    - Subcategory
    - Description
    - Features (JSON)
    - Specifications (JSON)
    - Images (JSON)
  - Added documentation:
    - Updated architecture documentation with admin interface details
    - Added component documentation
    - Added API documentation
- **Status**: Products CRUD functionality is complete and ready for testing.
- **Next Steps**:
  - Implement Content Management CRUD
  - Add User Management features
  - Develop Content Engine integration
