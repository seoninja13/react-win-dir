### Vertex AI Service Test Scripts (`Relume-root/src/lib/vertex-ai/`)

Test scripts are available to validate the core Vertex AI services. These services use dynamic imports for Google Cloud SDKs and an asynchronous factory pattern. Due to complexities with `ts-node` and ESM module resolution, the test scripts must be bundled using `esbuild` before execution.

**Prerequisites for all Vertex AI test scripts:**

- Ensure `esbuild` is installed as a dev dependency (`npm install --save-dev esbuild`).
- Ensure `dotenv` is installed as a project dependency (`npm install dotenv`).
- A valid `.env.local` file in the project root with `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT`, `GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION`, and `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` configured.

#### 1. Vertex AI Image Generation (`VertexAIImageService`)

Validates the `VertexAIImageService` for generating images.

**A. Build the Image Generation Test Script:**

Run the following command from the project root to bundle the TypeScript test script into a JavaScript ESM module:

```bash
npx esbuild Relume-root/src/lib/vertex-ai/test-image-generation.ts --bundle --outfile=dist/test-image-generation.mjs --platform=node --format=esm --external:dotenv --external:google-auth-library --external:@google-cloud/vertexai --color=true
```

**B. Run the Bundled Image Generation Test Script:**

Execute the bundled script from the project root:

```bash
node --no-warnings dist/test-image-generation.mjs
```

This will run the test, attempting to initialize the Vertex AI service and generate a sample image, logging the output to the console.

#### 2. Vertex AI Text Generation (`VertexAITextService`)

Validates the `VertexAITextService` for generating text using the `gemini-2.0-flash` model.

**A. Build the Text Generation Test Script:**

Run the following command from the project root:

```bash
npx esbuild Relume-root/src/lib/vertex-ai/test-text-generation.ts --bundle --outfile=dist/test-text-generation.mjs --platform=node --format=esm --external:dotenv --external:@google-cloud/vertexai --color=true
```

**B. Run the Bundled Text Generation Test Script:**

Execute the bundled script from the project root:

```bash
node --no-warnings dist/test-text-generation.mjs
```

This will run the test, attempting to initialize the `VertexAITextService` and generate sample text for predefined prompts, saving the output to `output/generated_text.json`.

Ensure the `dist/` and `output/` directories are in your `.gitignore` file.

### Image Generation Components

1. **Image Generation Script** (`scripts/generate-images.js`)
   - Generate images using natural language prompts
   - Supports various image sizes and configurations
   - Includes rate limiting and error handling
   - Saves images with metadata for tracking

2. **Image Management Utilities** (`scripts/image-utils.js`)
   - Track and manage generated images
   - Store metadata including prompts and generation parameters
   - Query and filter generated images

3. **Test Suite** (`scripts/test-image-generation.js`)
   - Comprehensive test cases for image generation
   - Multiple test categories and configurations
   - Detailed reporting and statistics

### Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites**
   - Node.js 16+
   - npm 9.x or higher
   - Google API key with access to the Gemini API
   - Required dependencies (install with `npm install`)

2. **Configuration**

   Create a `.env` file in the project root with your API key:

   ```env
   GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

3. **Usage**

   ```bash
   # Generate a single image
   npm run generate:image "A beautiful sunset over mountains"

   # Generate with custom options
   npm run generate:image "A futuristic city" -- --width 1280 --height 720 --numberOfImages 2

   # Run the test suite
   npm run test:image-gen
   ```
