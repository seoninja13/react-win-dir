                How does the 4000 Series compare to real wood siding?
              </AccordionTrigger>
              <AccordionContent className="md:pb-6">
                The 4000 Series provides the authentic look of custom milled wood siding 
                without the maintenance concerns. Our advanced texturing technology replicates 
                the natural grain patterns and architectural profiles of premium wood siding 
                with remarkable accuracy. Unlike wood, however, the 4000 Series never needs 
                painting, staining, or sealing, is impervious to insects and rot, and won't 
                warp, crack, or split over time. It also offers superior energy efficiency 
                and comes with a comprehensive warranty that wood siding can't match.
