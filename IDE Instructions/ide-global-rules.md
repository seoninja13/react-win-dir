# Global Rules

Do not delete files unrelated to the task you are working on.
When it comes to installing dependencies, or packages do not ask me, just go ahead and install them.
Every time you implement a feature, add that change in the @wWeb development progress folder @tracking-progress.md.
If there is a command "Need to install the following packages", go ahead and install them.
follow directions. I will tell you when to do it, what to do.If not 100% sure: ask me. Do not overwrite irrelevant code to the task, or any existing code uness is part of the scope of the project or task you are workign on. Before you start creating new files, or edit, make sure to read the Project documentation, starting with readme.md.
npx kill-port 8888 3000 && npx netlify dev --force  wont work , do nto use "&&" to join 2 statement/comands, use ";" or seperate statements. Instead use,examle: rm -rf .next; npx netlify dev
[]: # Build the project using yarn build: This will ensure that all the changes are properly compiled and optimized for production.

[]: # Run the development server using yarn dev: This will start the development server with the updated build.

Before you satrt creating new files/folders, make sure there no exostng one/ones first.
-- wehn replacing existing placeholder images with other images: Preserve the exsting layout, css properties, etc. Just replace  the images.
when the contextual windows reached 800000 stop, and take notes, update the documentation.

-- when replacing existing placeholder images with other images: Preserve the exsting layout, css properties, etc. Just replace  the images.

-- youa a senior engineer. Once you create a plan, implement it, execute all commands, be more self reliant and stopn asking me constantly , or keep giving me commands to run. Unless states otherwse,plan, implement it, execute all commands, be more self reliant and stopn asking me constantly , or keep giving me commands to run.

I want to use heavy commented code.

Executing all necessary commands automatically, be as much autonimous as possible. I can always accept the blue buttn and run commands for you.

Start all project documentation from the 1 single entry point README.md. follow the pyramid hierarchical structure.
Before creating any scripts, alway check for existing scripts
Every time before committing any code, make sure to document all code , features, flows, etc to the project documentation.
when running any flows, always first check whether we have existing files for that flow.

Always use Context7 MCP server to refference documentation for libraries like pydantic AI and Streamlit.
For the token start with 5000 but then increse to 20000 if your first search didnt return any relevant documentation.
Only search three times max for any specific piece of information. If you dont get what you need, use the Brave MCP server. to perform a wider search.

Before you start creating new files, scripts folders, ask me.
If you emconter the same error more than three time, kill all ports and run Netlify dev. If that dent fix it, document the troubleshooting you did in the documentation, and continue troubleshooting trying another approach.
Do not sql query columns in tables which do not exist.
